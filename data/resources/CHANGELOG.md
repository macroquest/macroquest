  as appropriate by utilizing int64_t where arbitrary values may occur (like damage or healing values)
  and cast to int where they do not (like SPA or spell id values).

  called or not. Now, we just always expect you to call it if you called Begin.

  a global context

    require 'ImGui'
    local TEXT_BASE_WIDTH, _ = ImGui.CalcTextSize("A")
    function DemoFeatureImGui()
        -- do update
    end
    ImGui.Register('DemoFeature', DemoFeatureImGui)

  custom UI addition is loaded (or not).

Mar 16 2020

Jan 25 2020
-// ***************************************************************************
-// Function:    DoHotbutton
-// Description: our '/hotbutton' command
-//              Extends the built in /hotbutton command with multiple lines support
-// Usage:       /hotbutton [Name] <color> <Line:><Cursor:>[Text]
-//				<Line can be 1-5
-//				<Cursor can ONLY be 0 which means DO NOT put the hotbutton on the cursor.
-//				Usage:
-//				/hotbutton TheName 14 1:0:/echo hi	(Where 14 1:0: in this case means use color 14, then place /echo hi on LINE 1 and NO Cursor Attachment.)
-//				/hotbutton TheName 14 1:/echo hi	(Where 14 1: in this case means use color 14, then place /echo hi on LINE 1.)
-//				/hotbutton TheName 1:0:/echo hi		(Where 1:0: in this case means place /echo hi on LINE 1 and NO Cursor Attachment.)
-//				/hotbutton TheName 1:/echo hi		(Where 1: in this case means place /echo hi on LINE 1.)
-//				/hotbutton TheName 0:/echo hi		(Where 0: in this case means NO Cursor Attachment.)
-//				Finally, just doing /hotbutton TheName 14 /echo hi OR /hotbutton TheName /echo hi just calls the eq function like before.
-// ***************************************************************************

Jan 21 2020
- Added .Size to the Window TLO, it returns a string x,y

- Updated MQ2Melee
- If you use builder don't forget to recheck it.

Jan 13 2020
- Updated max level to 115
- Updated the skillmanager for all builds.

Jan 13 2020 by Chatwiththisname
- Added MQ2SpellType Members: HastePct, SlowPct.
- Added GetMeleeSpeedPctFromSpell(PSPELL, bool) (Exported in Main)
- Added GetMeleeSpeedFromTriggers(PSPELL, bool) (not exported)
- Added HasTrigger(PSPELL) (not exported)
		GetMeleeSpeedPctFromSpell is used in HastePct and SlowPct.
		If the pSpell has a trigger it will automatically check the triggers for the modification speed. 
		Examples: 
			${Target.Slowed.SlowPct}
			${Me.Hasted.HastePct}
			${Spell[Slowing Helix].SlowPct}
			etc etc.
- Fixed GetSelfBuffBySPA(int, bool, int);
- Fixed GetTargetBuffBySPA(int, bool, int);
- Fixed GetSelfShortBuffBySPA(int, bool, int);
- Fixed HasCachedTargetBuffSPA(int, bool, PSPAWNINFO, PcTargetBuff);

	In all the above SPA buff checks if the SPA matched, but wasn't the increase or decrease
	desired, it would stop checking anymore buffs. 
	Example: ${Target.Slowed} should return a pSpellType of a slow debuff on the target. But
		if the target had a haste buff before the slow buff it would find SPA 11 and since it was
		an increase instead of a decrease it would return -1, or NULL. Changing it to break; for those
		SPA's allows it to continue checking the buffs and find any subsequent SPA 11's correctly.

Jan 12 2020

  Now: pCont->pEvolutionData->EvolvingCurrentLevel
  The Following are members of pEvolutionData: GroupID, EvolvingCurrentLevel, EvolvingExpPct, EvolvingMaxLevel, LastEquipped;
- ItemColor is now gone from CONTENTS.

- Added .Flagged to the DZMemberType TLO it returns true if the dzmember can successfully enter the dz.
- Usage: ${DynamicZone.Member[x].Flagged} where x is either index or the name.

Nov 14 2019 by brainiac
- Re-fixed EQINVSLOTWND
- Added ALT_MEMBER_GETTER macro that defines an alternate name that a member can be
  accessed with, thereby removing the need to immediately update all code to use new
  variable names.
- You can now use the old, or the new names for Slot1, Slot2, Slot3, Location and *suprise* Wnd.

Nov 13 2019

- Right Clicking the Lucy button on the item display window will now open Lucy in your external default browser.
  Left Click opens it inside of eq as usual.

Nov 04 2019
- Task TLO can now be accessed by index to make iteration possible.
  Example: /echo ${Task[2].Title}
  NOTE: THIS INDEX IS NOT THE SAME INDEX AS THE ONE YOU SEE IN THE QUEST WINDOW LIST.
        We are iterating through the IN MEMORY quest entries, we are NOT
		iterating the window list, if you want to do that, use the Window TLO.
- Added .WindowIndex to the Task TLO it returns the Quest Window List Index. (if the window actually have the list filled...)
  Usage: /echo ${Task[3].WindowIndex}
  Usage: /echo ${Task[Into The Muck].WindowIndex}

Nov 02 2019
- Added item search by number to the ${Ground} TLO
- Example: /echo ${Ground[4]} will return the 4th closest item it finds.
- You should probably check that there actually are 4 items on the ground 
  with ${GroundItemCount} though, or it will obviously return NULL if there is'nt.
  I don't know how useful this feature is since we can iterate through .Next anyway, but someone asked for it so...

Nov 01 2019
- Added ${Me.Origin} which returns a pZoneType of your starting city.

Oct 26 2019 by SwiftyMUSE

Oct 16 2019 by Eqmule
- Updated for LIVE
- I am aware the .Select for the task tlo needs a fix, I can't get that in right now but will be looking at a fix the next couple days.
- Use the window tlo meanwhile if u need to select in that window.

Oct 09 2019 by Chatwiththisname
- Added two new /mapfilter options for CampRadius and PullRadius.
- They add two new circles that work like SpellRadius except it's stationary where set.
- Type /mapfilter for help.

Oct 02 2019 by Eqmule
- Made some changes to the ${Task} TLO
- It's likely some macros will break due to these changes, but
  I felt the upside with not having to rely on the window warrants that.

- New Feature: It's no longer needed to have the task window open to access the TLO.
- Added .Type to the TaskObjective TLO
  It returns a string that can be one of the following:
  Unknown,None,Deliver,Kill,Loot,Hail,Explore,Tradeskill,Fishing,
  Foraging,Cast,UseSkill,DZSwitch,DestroyObject,Collect,Dialogue
- Added .CurrentCount which returns the current count of the .Type needed to complete a objective.
- Added .RequiredCount which returns the required count of the .Type needed to complete a objective.
- Added .Optional which returns true or false if a objective is optional
- Added .RequiredItem which returns a string of the required item to complete a objective.
- Added .RequiredSkill which returns a string of the required skill to complete a objective.
- Added .RequiredSpell which returns a string of the required spell to complete a objective.
- Added .DZSwitchID which returns a int of the switch used in a objective.
- Example: /echo ${Task[The Grand Illusion].Objective[1].CurrentCount}
- Added .ID to the ${Task} TLO it returns an int of the task ID
- Example: /echo ${Task[The Grand Illusion].ID}
- Ok so fair warning, the taskwindow doesn't add items by index, unless sorted by first column,
  and even then, it can be "off" (because reasons)
  so... if you are smart don't use ${Task[1].ID} and expect it to be whatever is the first list item.
  ALWAYS refer to taks by their NAME.
  so like: ${Task[The Grand Illusion].Step.Index} WILL absolutely always return the correct index
  as returned by the taskmanager, but it might not be the index you "see" in the window.
  Bottomline, we should not rely on the window anymore.
  It's useful to look up the name of the tasks, basically.

- Parser gets reset to the default in your ini whenever a macro ends
- Full documentation at https://gitlab.com/Knightly1/mq2-parser-changes

Aug 21 2019 by EqMule

- Fixed the parser so it can run at charselect again. (Don't run macros there that need access to ingame variables...)

Aug 16 2019 by EqMule

- Removed EQ_END_ZONE and EQ_BEGIN_ZONE.

- Added ${SubDefined[blah]} it returns a bool if a Macro Sub is defined. -cred alynel
- Previously Added: .CachedBuff[x] to the spawn tlo where x is a spellid if its a number and a spell name if not. It returns a MQ2CachedBuffType.
- Previously Added: .CachedBuff[#x] to the spawn tlo where #x is a buffslot between 1-97. It returns a MQ2CachedBuffType.
- Previously Added: .CachedBuff[*x] to the spawn tlo where *x is a index (buffslots are not sorted). It returns a MQ2CachedBuffType.
- Previously Added: .CachedBuff[^x] to the spawn tlo where ^x is a keyword. It returns a MQ2CachedBuffType.
	^x keywords: Slowed Rooted Mezzed Crippled Maloed Tashed Snared and Beneficial

- MQ2CachedBuffType has the following members:
	.CasterName .Count .Slot .SpellID .Duration

- Previously Added: .CachedBuffCount to the spawn tlo. it returns -1 if no buffs are cached for the spawn or number of buffs cached.
- Using CachedBuff to get buff info on targets, group members etc, only requires you to target the entity once. after thats done, buffs are cached.
- The upside is obviously that we don't have to target back and forth constantly.
- Usage: well lets say you are a druid and you want to know if a group members sow buff has worn off, you can just check CachedBuff without having to retarget the group member.
- /echo ${Group.Member[2].CachedBuff[Spirit of Wolf].Duration}

- Fixed /dosocial
- Some other stuff I'll documment later.

May 24 2019 by EqMule
- BuffsPopulated returns 1 for a empty buff list and a number above 1 if there was some buffs received.
  So if you do /echo ${Target.BuffsPopulated} and it returns 1 it means the target does not have any actual buffs, but the list was received (and it was empty).
  any number above 1 means the list was not empty...
  NOTE: Use ${Target.BuffCount} to get the ACTUAL VISIBLE buffs (BuffsPopulated is BuffCount + 1)
- Some other stuff I'll documment later.

May 23 2019 by EqMule
- Added the possibility to login new characters using plaintext credentials, no mq2 login profile needed:
	Usage:
	/loginchar servername^login^charname^password
	AND if you want to stop at charselect don't specify charname:
	/loginchar servername^login^password
- Made /quit command work at charselect
- Added a Syntax Error to the parser when you try to parse strings greater than 2048 instead of crashing you.

- Fixed Get Current Mana and Get Current Endurance
- Fixed MQ2Rez spam (yes really this time)
- MQ2Rez will now wait 1/10 of a second before clicking rez.
- Added /rez delay #### parameter where #### is milliseconds.
  default is 100 milliseconds.
- Added a /mqchat reset command. It resets mq2 window location in case it got moved off screen.
- All instances of the CSidlScreenWnd constructor has been fixed to use CXStr& instad of CXStr* (because it should be)
  Change plugins accordingly.
  Examples:
	change:
	CEQBCWnd(CXStr* Template) : CCustomWnd(Template)
	to 
	CEQBCWnd(CXStr& Template) : CCustomWnd(Template)

	change:
	class CXStr ChatWnd("ChatWindow");
	BCWnd = new CEQBCWnd(&ChatWnd);
	to
	BCWnd = new CEQBCWnd(CXStr("ChatWindow"));

- MQUI XML files may now be loaded from the MQ2 directory. Place them in
  the MQ2 directory under uifiles/default, or the name of your ui like you
  would in the EQ directory. When loading ui files, MQ2 will check for ui files
  in the MQ2 dir before checking in the EQ dir as it did before.

  To be clear, this is the search order for ui files:
  * <MQDir>\uifiles\<skin>
  * <MQDir>\uifiles\default
  * <EQDir>\uifiles\<skin>
  * <EQDir>\uifiles\default

  This lets you store your MQ2 ui files in your MQ2 directory, as well as giving
  you the option of storing your MQ2-specific custom uis outside the EQ folder.

- added c++ function: bool IsXMLFilePresent(const char*) for plugin authors to easily
  check if an XML file is available to be loaded. This will check all four locations where
  a ui file might be stored.
- added command: /reloadui
  It works just like "/loadskin <skinname> 1" but with less typing

- Changed a bunch of stuff, plugin authors you have until next patch to update your plugins.
- If you ned help mail the plugin to me and ill send it back fixed: eqmule@hotmail.com
  ALL global plugins in builder have been updated by me already, look at them for examples.
  No more direct access to the window struct members in prep for moving to classes.
  From now on call functions to get/put data out/in:
  Example: too many to list see CSW struct.
  I'll list 4 examples:  previously pWnd->XMLIndex now: pWnd->GetXMLIndex()
                         previously pWnd->dShow==false now: pWnd->IsVisible()==false
						 previously pWnd->dShow = true now: pWnd->SetVisible(true)
						 previously SetCXStr(&pWnd->WindowText,"blah"); now pWnd->CSetWindowText("blah");
						 previously GetCXStr(pWnd->WindowText,szOut); now GetCXStr(pWnd->CGetWindowText(),szOut);
- Added .NoExpendReagentID to the Spell tlo.
  Usage: /echo ${Spell[Burst of Fire].NoExpendReagentID[x]} where x can be 1-4
  This returns the ID of the needed Reagent you have to have in your inventory but will not be spent.

- Enjoy marking items for sale in the FindItem Window.
  Usage: mark some items while you have a merchant open, then click the Sell Marked button.

- Updated for TEST
- Updated for LIVE
- Uncheck and Recheck the following Builder Plugins because they have been updated:
  MQ2Cast
  MQ2Radar

- In preperation for next weeks live patch the following offsets has been removed:
	pinstAggroInfo_x
	pinstAuraMgr_x
	pinstEQItemList_x
	pinstMercAltAbilities_x
	pinstRealEstateItems_x
	pinstCTargetManager_x
	pinstCTextOverlay_x
	pinstEQObjectList_x
- All of the above offsets are no longer static in the client so I have replaced them with 
  calls to the proper Instance/Get functions instead.

- Plugin authors, you need to make a few changes to access some SPAWNINFO members from now on:
  (don't change any other struct members if they happen to have the same name!)
  All instances of ->SpellCooldownETA needs to be changed to ->GetSpellCooldownETA()
  All instances of ->spawneqc_info needs to be changed to ->GetCharacter()
  All instances of ->ManaMax needs to be changed to ->GetMaxMana()
  All instances of ->ManaCurrent needs to be changed to ->GetCurrentMana()
  All instances of ->EnduranceMax needs to be changed to ->GetMaxEndurance()
  All instances of ->EnduranceCurrent needs to be changed to ->GetCurrentEndurance()
  All instances of ->Zone needs to be changed to ->GetZoneID()

- GetCastingTimeModifier and GetFocusRangeModifier has been changed to deal with a ctd.
- All plugin that call these needs to be changed, search for them and see how I fixed it in core.
- No plugins should call the EQ_Character1::GetCastingTimeModifier and EQ_Character1::GetFocusRangeModifier directly
- ALWAYS call the wrappers in mq2inlines. (well you can continue calling them directly but good luck with the crashes)
- Fixed crashes in the spell tlo members .MyCastTime and .MyRange
- CONTENTS member ItemType has been renamed to RefCount
- This member should never ever be set or changed manually in plugins,
- it's an internal eqgame counter, if you mess with it you are going to screw up checksums and get disconnected.
- MQ2Cast needs to be updated look at the builder global version if you need help.

- Added a new column to the Find Item Window which will let you mark items for delete or add them to never loot filter.
  Usage: mark some items by checking the ckecboxes, then click the Never Loot button to set their never loot advloot filter.
  Usage: mark some items by checking the ckecboxes, then click the Destroy Items button to delete them.

- It goes without saying, that if you have no idea what you are doing or if you are a complete imbecile, this feature might
  be too dangerous for you to have enabled, in which case you can disable it by right clicking the Destroy Item or the Never Loot button
  and then toggle the "Cool Checkbox Feature" on the menu that pops up. Default is ON.

Jan 07 2019 by SwiftyMUSE
- Added .Dotted to ${Me} and ${Target}
- Added .MaxMeleeTo to ${Target}
- Updated .Foreground in EverQuest TLO
  While not technically required... (although it improves performance)
  Anyone using GetForegroundWindow() call should change their code
  to use the new exported gbInForeground instead of making calls in the plugin pulse function.
  These Global builder plugins are updated so as not unnecessarily using cpu in pulse:
  MQ2AdvPath, MQ2CpuLoad, MQ2FPS and MQ2Radar
  These Personal plugins should be updated, including, but not limited to:
  MQ2Clip, MQ2Focus, MQ2Nav, MQ2SoD, MQ2Task, MQ2ViewPort, MQ2WinPath

Jan 03 2019 by EqMule
- ${Me.Ability[#|X]} now return the real ID/Name of a Ability...
  Example /echo ${Me.Ability[Hide]}
  returns: 29
  /echo ${Me.Ability[29]}
  returns: Hide

  Before this change doing ${Me.Ability[Hide]} would return whatever number 1-6 you had assigned to Hide in Abilities.
  NOW it returns 29, which is the actual ability ID for Hide.

- /doability # now takes REAL ability IDs as well as the "fake ones", which are 1-6
  This means you can do /doability 29 and it will activate the Hide ability since it's REAL ID is 29...
  You can also still do /doability 1 and if you have Hide assigned as 1 in your abilities tab on the actions window, it will activate it.
  This is kinda stupid though, so I recommend just doing /doability Hide instead, and 
  don't worry about where its assigned or not assigned at all...
- Added Run To, to the groupwindow rightclick menu, it will run you over to the group member you clicked.

Dec 19 2018 by SwiftyMUSE
- Added .Feared, .Silenced, .Invulnerable to ${Me} and ${Target}

- Added .Foreground to EverQuest TLO
- Added .BaseName to Spell TLO (spell name w/o any Rk. XXX crap)
- Fixed Me.GemTimer to clamp return to 0 after spell is ready to cast 

Dec 18 2018 by eqmule
- Updated for LIVE
- Updated for TEST
- Added Quest items to the autobank button rightclick menu
- Added an option Autoinventory from bank back to inventory (reverse AutoBank basically).
- /loadskin and /camp out/in out will not break this new feature anymore.

Dec 17 2018 by eqmule
- New Fature: AutoBank Filter : idea cred Kaen01
- Basically rightclick the autobank button to set options for items you like to autobank
  Click AutoBank Button WITHOUT anything on the cursor.
  If you have something on cursor AutoBank will just work like it always have and autobank the item
  BUT if your cursor is empty it will autobank:
  Collectibles if you have that option set. (off by default)
  Tradeskill Items if you have that option set. (off by default)
  Right now those are the two types of items it works for, I'm not against other item types so if anyone has some clever ideas let me know.
  Known Issue: need to add reloadui support so it's a little bit beta still, but anyway, I'll fix that later.

Dec 13 2018 by eqmule
- Updated for LIVE
- Updated the LOOTITEM struct
  This fix will break plugins that use that struct.
  Search the source for ->LootDetails.m_array to see how it should be fixed.
- NotifyOnServerUP in mq2autologin.ini can be left at =1 or =2 now, it will only trigger on server is up after server is detected as LOCKED or DOWN when the plugin first checks it.

Dec 11 2018 by eqmule TBL Launch
- Updated for LIVE
- Placeholders in mq2targetinfo for the PH button on the target window has been updated for TBL
- Made mq2autologin not try to join a locked/down server.
- Added NotifyOnServerUP to the mq2autologin inifile in the [Settings] section.
  If you set it to NotifyOnServerUP=1 it will BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP when server is up.
  If you set it to NotifyOnServerUP=2 it will also email you if you have the mq2gmail plugin loaded and correctly configured.
  You can try /gmail "hi there" "test" in game, if u get that, u will also get the autologin notification.
  Or just leave the setting as NotifyOnServerUP=0 and it wont bother u at all.
  I find it useful to enable it on patchday's when servers are LOCKED/DOWN
  Under normal circumstances, it should be set to 0, unless u really like 10 seconds of BEEEEEEPING everytime u login...

Dec 10 2018 by eqmule

- The following feature has been on my todo list forever and was brought to life by @Knightly, all hail Knightly!
  Thanks for your support.
- Added the ability to interact with menus - cred : Knightly
  Example: /notify "open the door to the lobby" menuselect
  It will search the currently open menu for the words "open the door" and click that menu item if it finds it.
  the search is case insensitive and sub strings are fine
  thus you could just do /notify "open the" menuselect and it would still find and click that item
- 
- Added a new TLO: MQ2MenuType it inherits the Window TLO.
  It has 1 method:
	.Select : It will select a menu item (click it)
	usage: /invoke ${Menu.Select[open the door]}
	Output: none, it just clicks that entry if it finds it.

  It has 6 members:
	.Address : pIntType it returns the address of the currently open menu.
	.NumVisibleMenus : pIntType it returns number of currently visible menus. Ordinarily this is going to be 1 if a menu is showing and 0 if not
	.CurrMenu : pIntType it returns the index for the currently visible menu. Ordinarily this will be 0 if a menu is open and -1 if not
	.Name : pStringType it returns the name of the menu or the first items name.
	.NumItems = : pIntType it returns number of items in the currently open menu.
	.Items : pStringType it returns the Itemname specified by Index
--  Usage Examples:
--	/echo ${Menu.Name}
	Output: Shabby Lobby Door
	/echo ${Menu.Open} (it inherits Window TLO, remember?)
	Output: TRUE
	/echo ${Menu.NumItems}
	Output: 4
	/echo ${Menu.Items[2]}
	Output: Adjust Placement
- Added some door defines.

Dec 06 2018 by eqmule

  I don't want to say to much about it really there isn't much to say
  from a users perspective everything works like before.
  Basically the only difference should be that /items now display grounditems in guild halls as well.
  if ${Ground} or /itemtarget or whatever does not work as before let me know.
- Added /click right item
  this is mostly useful for like grounditems like shabby lobby door and so on that pops up
  a menu when you rightclick them.
- Work in progress -> adding a method to click menu items in the currently open menu.

- This means if you dont want those buttons on the group window, just rightclick
  a group member and hide them, then create your own hotbuttons
  and put them wherever you like to get the same functionallity.
- Fixed a bug in mq2targetinfo that would change the alpha of the targetwindow/groupwindow/exttargetwindow

- Let's pretend yesterday's release didnt happen, mq2targetinfo was bugged, so we try again:
- Updated for BETA, LIVE and TEST
- Added /groupinfo reset if you have ANY problem at all with default UI, just run this command it will reset to WORKING ini.
  Old settings will be saved in MQ2TargetInfo.bak

- Added /groupinfo reload
  you can use it to reload the ini when you make changes to button locations etc.
- I made a lot of changes to how mq2targetinfo adds itself to the UI
  Basically if you have a custom UI it will now save button locations and so on in it's own section of the ini file.

- Custom UI Extended Target Window crash fixed in MQ2TargetInfo.

Nov 23 2018 by eqmule
- Updated for BETA
- Added MORE support for custom UI's to MQ2targetInfo
  I don't know much about custom UI' as I have only used a couple of them
  and my experience with them, well i was not impressed, the reason is that they are outdated
  they dont show aggro percentages, they use hardcoded sizes and thus cant be resized, cant be moved, has no title, etc.
  Honestly, its a mess, if u have a good UI that has all the same controls as default, you are lucky.
  Now, to workaround these limitations, I have made some changes to MQ2targetInfo:
  First of all if your group window is not resizable, ill change it so it is.
  Second if it doesnt have proper .TopOffset I'll use Location.top instead and so on.
  Suffice to say, I have done my best to make this work for everyone.
  If this still isnt enough, you are going to have to actually edit either mq2targetinfo.ini
  and set the button locations there, or edit your UI's XML files.
  Well, or just unload mq2targetinfo...

  Bottomline is, the code I added now, should at a minimum not crash your custom UI
  and there is a good chance it actually works for it as well, although u might have to resize the window
  in order to see all buttons and distance etc.

Nov 22 2018 by eqmule thanksgiving edition.
- Updated for BETA
- I now disable MQ2TargetInfo for incompatible UI's
  I plan on fixing it but I dont have time today.

- Started the Task TLO overhaul, we are going to be able to access these things without having to have the window open.
  This also means we can now add some new members to it, like the type of task, reward, npc to turn into etc.
  More to come.

  Rightclick groupwindow and check or uncheck the menu for it to hide/show them.
  or use /groupinfo help
  There is no way to selectivly show only one or two, the show is either for all three or none.
  Because, well it makes the most sense and I dont want to clutter up the menu with 3 settings for it.

- Added distance for targets on the Extended Target Window
  You can control the feature by: /groupinfo show/hide extdistance
  Because distance label needs a few pixels to display, u *might* need to make the window a bit wider,
  it depends how many letters are in the mobs name that u fight.
- MQ2TargetInfo.ini now lets you customize what commands, texts and tooltips are executed/displayed for the Follow Me and Come To Me buttons
  Default entries are:
  [code]
	ComeToMeText=Come To Me
	ComeToMeCommand=/bcg //nav id ${Me.ID}
	ComeToMeToolTip=/bcg //nav id ${Me.ID}
	FollowMeText=Follow Me
	FollowMeCommand=/bcg //afollow spawn ${Me.ID}
	FollowMeeToolTip=/bcg //afollow spawn ${Me.ID}

  This means /itemnotify in <pack#> <slot#> rightmouseup will work again.
- FirstFreeSlot now returns -1 if no freeslot is found.
- FirstFreeSlot returns 0-whatever, it does NOT start counting on 1 anymore.
  This means: if it return 0 the FIRST slot is in fact empty.
  if it returns 1 the SECOND slot is in fact empty, etc.
  We do this because in real life, from a coders perpective, arrays start at 0. not 1.
  and, thats just the way it should be.

- MQ2TargetInfo has been updated.
  You can now set UsePerCharSettings=1 if you want that in MQ2TargetInfo.ini.
  0 is default and means it reads settings from the [Default] section.
  I realized that having per char settings is cumbersome if you have A LOT of chars.
  The buttons on the groupwindow will only show when you are in a group now.
  Except the Hotbutton which will always show unless you change its show/hide setting. see /groupinfo help for more info.
- Added a tooltip for /groupinfo help on the main groupwindow.

Oct 22 2018 by eqmule
- Added some more good stuff to mq2targetinfo
- Fixed clicking playername in group window.
- Added a button called "Mimic Me" to the group window.
	If you have mq2eqbc loaded the button will work and will
	make your whole group do what you do, if u target someone they will all target your target.
	if you say something they will all repeat what you say.
	This is great for tasks etc.

    This makes the character you selected the menu on pick up the nearest grounditem to him/her
- Added "Click nearest door" to the rightclick menu in the groupwindow.

- MQ2TargetInfo has been updated.
- Added Distance to group members next to their name in the groupwindow.
- Added a button to the group window called "Come to Me"
	If you have mq2eqbc, mq2nav and mq2advpath and a proper mq2nav mesh loaded
	the button will work and will make your whole group come running to you.

- Added a button called "Follow Me" to the group window.
	If you have mq2eqbc and mq2advpath loaded the button will work and will
	make your whole group follow you around.

- Added a new character TLO member: Bandolier it has 4 members: Index,Active,Name,Item
    it has one method: Activate
	Usage: (assuming you have a bandoiler saved as "1HB")
	| check if its active:
	[code]
	/if (!${Me.Bandolier[${Bandolier[1HB].Active}) {
		/echo [${Time}] player want us to activate Bandolier: 1HB.
		/invoke ${Me.Bandolier[1HB].Activate}
	}
	/echo I have a ${Me.Bandolier[1HB].Item[1].Name} in my primary bandoilier slot
	Output: I have a Snowreaver in my primary bandoilier slot
	Item returns a bandolieritemtype which has 4 members: Index,ID,IconID,Name
	[/code]

- Made some adjustments to the ${Ground} TLO and added .First and .Last members to it.
	  /echo ${Ground} will now return the FIRST item in the list if you DO NOT done a /itemtarget
	  in which case it will return that item.
	  Prior to this change ${Ground} would just return NULL if an /itemtarget had not been performed.
	- Fixed a bug in ${Ground} which prevented it from be used as a type
	  Example:
	  [code]
	  |a Macro to show how to use /vardata
	|/vardata does NOT work like /varset
	|Opening and closing the dataportion must NOT use ${}

	#turbo 120

	Sub Main
		/declare MyGroundItem		ground		local
		/declare Count			int		local
	
		|Start by just setting it to the first entry found in the grounditems list:
		| NOTE that I DO NOT USE ${Ground.First}, but Ground.First that's just how /vardata works, so accept it.
		/vardata MyGroundItem Ground.First

		/for Count 1 to ${GroundItemCount}
			/echo \a-w${Count}. \awID: \at${MyGroundItem.ID} \awDist: \ay${MyGroundItem.Distance} \ag${MyGroundItem.DisplayName}
        		|move to next:
			/if (${Bool[${MyGroundItem.Next}]}) {
				/vardata MyGroundItem MyGroundItem.Next
			} else {
				/break
			}
		/next Count
	/return
	[/code]

- Fixed AAPointsAssigned in the CHARINFO2 struct, it is actually an array.
	Prior to this fix we used it like this: pChar2->AAPointsAssigned;
	Now we use it like this: pChar2->AAPointsAssigned[0];
	It contains points spent in each aa category. the first one is just total...

- Fixed a bug with /advloot giveto
- Cleaned up and completed the _EQCASTSPELLGEM struct, we have been using it wrong for years it seems.
- TimeStamp in the EQCASTSPELLGEM has been removed and is now (correctly) part of the CBUTTONWND struct
  it is named (correctly) CoolDownBeginTime there.

- RecastTime in the EQCASTSPELLGEM has been removed and is now (correctly) part of the CBUTTONWND struct
  it is named (correctly) CoolDownDuration there.

- The 2 above changes means plugins might need to be edited if they used the old struct.
  Here is an example of how to fix this:
  change:
  return g->TimeStamp + g->RecastTime - EQGetTime();
  to:
  return g->Wnd.CoolDownBeginTime + g->Wnd.CoolDownDuration - EQGetTime();
- Started on adding support for the UF emu client, no eta for when it will build.
- The EMU #define has been renamed to ROF2EMU
- Added a #define for UFEMU
  This means if you plugin was previously using #if defined(EMU) !defined or #ifdef or #ifndef
  it need to to properly add in defined(ROF2EMU) && defined(UFEMU) or the !defined in the proper places

  if (Cast->CastOnYou[0]) {
	sprintf_s(Temps, "%s#*#", Cast->CastOnYou);
  [/code]
  changed to
  [code]

- Added new TLO member XTAggroCount to ${Me}
  Usage: /echo ${Me.XTAggroCount} or ${Me.XTAggroCount[100]}
  it returns the number of AUTO-HATER mobs on the extended
  target window where your aggro is less than the optional
  parameter N. N must be between 1-100 inclusive or it will be
  set to 100 (the default value).
  So, ${Me.XTAggroCount} and ${Me.XTAggroCount[100]} are identical.

- Added a new command: /usercamera - feature request by Bogreaper
  You can use it to set the current camera as well as save/load settings for user camera 1
  NOTE: "User Camera 1" is actually camera number 3 in the client...
  Cameras are defined as follows:
  0 = First Person Cam
  1 = Overhead Cam
  2 = Chase Cam
  3 = User Cam 1
  4 = User Cam 2
  5 = Tether Cam
  6 = Zoom Cam
  7 = Internal Cam (don't ask, it just is ok. It is used for things like when you edit the facial features of your character etc.)

  Just type /usercamera without any arguments to see help for it.
  It will display the current active camera in the Selector Window titlebar, this can be toggled with /usercamera on/off default is on.
  Example: switch to camrea 3 by doing /usercamera 3
           Then, adjust it how you like it, type /usercamera save
		   Ok, that's it, next time u want to get back to that EXACT camera position, you just do /usercamera load
		   You can create hotkey(s) as well.
		   Optional: you can do /usercamera save eqmule and it will save it for eqmule (or whatever your chanracter name is), same thing with load.
		   if you omit the character name, it just saves is as a global camera.

- MAXTURBO has been moved to the ini file. cred: silverj
- Set TurboLimit under the [MacroQuest] section in the macroquest.ini to whatever, it defaults to 240.

- Obviously people are going to set this to 1000000000000000
- and then completely lock up their game, cause the engine will never ever yield time to eq, but hey... its their choice now I guess.
- I suggest you dont mess with it at all, and leave it at 240 max.

- Updated for LIVE

There will be no more public mq2 updates until I catch the guy that released the mq2 for agnarr.

send me a pm or skype text: eq.mule
if you have information. you can be anonymous.

longtime friends and loyal users here that I know and trust will be given the updates by me only from now on. (at no charge of course.) mq2 is still open source and free, its just that equistructs.h eqgame.h and eqdata.h wont be distributed or updated by me anymore. those change every patch and everything prior to this day is under gpl and can of course be requested or downloaded, but from now on until this crap is resolved, I have my own NEW includes that are NOT under the gpl.

I'm sick of having my hard work being taken and passed of by some leech on a server that I specifically requested we stay away from. I wont tolerate it.

mq2 is free and staying off of truebox was the only price people had to pay, cant do that? no mq2 for anyone anymore.

wanna step in and update it? lol go for it, it must be "easy" if eqmule can do it in a couple hours... pfft... yeah right...

/eqmule (yeah I'm bitter)

- Added ${Group.AvgHPs} guess what it returns? - eqmule

18 Sep 2017 by eqmule
- Fixed an infinite loop bug and a variable parse bug in Eval functions. -cred bug report: creamo
- Eval functions that take multiple arguments MUST separate those with comma(s) from now on
  Example: (run with a cleric, war or shaman)
  [code]
  Sub Main
	/declare c_argueString string outer shm clr war
	/declare ChatSender string local ${Me} 

	/if (!${checkbot["shm war clr", ${ChatSender}]}) { <-NOTE the COMMA
		/echo ${Time} Only Func3: FALSE, this should be TRUE
	} else {
		/echo ${Time} Only Func3: TRUE, this should be TRUE
	}
  /return

  Sub checkbot(selectedBots, chatSender)
    /declare botSelected bool local FALSE
	/echo ${Time} in Sub checkbot selectedBots=${selectedBots} chatSender=${chatSender}
    /if (${Select[${Me.Class.ShortName},${selectedBots}]}) /varset botSelected TRUE
  /return ${botSelected}
  [/code]

17 Sep 2017 by eqmule
- Fixed ${Me.GukEarned}, ${Me.MMEarned}, ${Me.RujEarned}, ${Me.TakEarned}, ${Me.MirEarned} and ${Me.LDoNPoints}
- Added a new TLO PointMercant it only have one member : Item which is a pPointMerchantItemType.
  The pPointMerchantitemType has the following members: Name, ItemID, Price, ThemeID, IsStackable, IsLore, RaceMask, ClassMask, bCanUse
  Usage:
  /echo ${PointMercant} returns true if the LDON Mercant window is open and FALSE if not.
  /echo ${PointMercant.Item[1].Price} OR /echo ${PointMercant.Item[Ebon Hammer].Price}
  returns the Price for index 1 or whatever index Ebon Hammer is in if you do it by name.
  etc.

15 Sep 2017 starring SwiftyMUSE as "the captain", eqmule as "crew member number 6" and special guest star: eqholic
- Updated to handle the new SPA's
- Fixed a bug in /next not taking its argument into account for nested for loops.
- Fix for labels
- Fixed the CSIDLWND struct (the SIDL define...) so since we have never had this right it was time, but note that
  if your plugin uses stuff like: pwnd->SidlText and its NOT an actual CSidlScreenWnd then you need to change it to whatever window it actually is.
  I guess questions about this should be directed to me (eqmule)

14 Sep 2017 by eqmule
- Updated for TEST
- Fixed ${Familiar[x].} it will return familiars and not illusions now...

- Fixed a bunch of window structs that we where completely misusing anyway.
  this could require some plugin changes, contact me for help if you get errors.

- Fix: Variables that are undeclared but supplied as paramters now default to an actual NULL or 0 not the string "NULL"

- Inspecting the Blessed Spiritstaff of the Heyokah will no longer ctd you.
- Added Math.Clamp ${Math.Clamp[Min, N, Max]} will clamp N between Min and Max. - cred derple
  Example:
  ${Math.Clamp[1, 15, 30]} => 15
  ${Math.Clamp[20, 15, 30]} => 20
  ${Math.Clamp[1, 15, 10]} => 10
  Practical usage:
  /bct ranger //stick id ${Target.ID} ${Math.Clamp[25,${Target.Distance},150]} 
  this will make your ranger stay put if he is already between 25-150 meters away
  otherwise it will move him at most 150 away and at least 25 away.

- Changed MQ2MoveUtils to save stuff faster.
- MQ2ChatWnd got a new tlo /echo ${ChatWnd.Title}
- MQ2ChatWnd got a new command /setchattitle
- MQ2Melee updated - it has flags for down and holyshits called downflag0-60 and holyflag0-60
  you SHOULD set those flags to 2 if you parse ANY macro variables.
  Example:
  [code]
  downflag0=2
  downshit0=/if (${Macro.Paused}) /echo ${Macro} is PAUSED!
  [/code]
- MQ2Hud now updated with a new type HUDTYPE_MACRO which is 16
  This means you can now set the type to any combination of 1 2 4 8 and 16
  see http://www.macroquest2.com/wiki/index.php/MQ2HUD for more info.
  Basically using a hud that tries to parse variables that are used in macros, before they are declared will fail.
  This new flag lets mq2hud know to not even try unless its set.

- Adding events from a macro will now also automatically /declare variable as outer if used.
  Example: #Event Burn              "[MQ2] |${BurnText}|"
  As you can see this event uses the variable ${BurnText} and it will therefor /declare it as well.
  This means you can remove /declare BurnText in your Sub Main since adding the event did it for you already.

- Added ${Macro.IsOuterVariable[xxx]} which returns TRUE/FALSE, it checks if a outer variable exists. (read is declared)
  I would recommend NOT using this in macros unless its for debug purposes because it can get quickly get expensive in terms of cpu cycles.

- Added ${Macro.IsTLO[xxx]} which returns TRUE/FALSE, it checks if a Top Level Object exists. This should be faster than checking if a plugin is loaded. *should*
  Usage:
    [code]
    /if (${Macro.IsTLO[Melee]}) {
        /echo yes there is a Melee Top Level Object loaded...
		/echo this means I CAN actually do stuff with it without it throwing the Undeclared warning:
		/delay 25 !${Melee.Combat}
    } else {
        /echo no there is no such TLO, maybe you should load mq2melee?
		/end
    }
    [/code]

- All Plugin Sources changed outside of core for this zip are attached to the post here:
http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=11451&p=174399#p174399
- using namespace std; has been removed from mq2main.h
  THIS MEANS your plugins will ERROR with lines like this:
  error C2143: syntax error: missing ';' before '<'
  The line: map<string, class CXWnd2 *> WindowMap;
  To fix: Find #include "../MQ2Plugin.h" in your plugin and add using namespace std; under the LAST #include below it.
  Example:
	[code]
	#include "../MQ2Plugin.h"
	#include <otherheader>
	...
	using namespace std;
	[/code]
	OR just change the line to say std:: map<std::string, class CXWnd2 *> WindowMap;

-  The reason for that change is that right now we litter ALL projects with the std namespace and it is just not good.
   Let everyone that needs that namespace use it in their own projects from now on.

- #bind(s) are now fixed and won't screw up the macrostack anymore.
- Todays update is significant because I rebuilt the macro engine to improve performance,
  it was well overdue. The biggest change is that gMacroBlock is now a map.
- Undeclared Variables are no longer tolerated, and the macroengine will not run at optimal speed
  if they exist. I have added a TLO to check for them because of this and a new macro keyword #warning as well
  so there is no good reason to run old macros where these kinds of variables hog cpu power:
AGAIN:   IMPORTANT: Undeclared variables will slow down macro performance a LOT if they are used over and over, so, fix your macros.

- The Macro TLO has a new method: .Undeclared
  Usage: /invoke ${Macro.Undeclared} and it will list all undeclared variables.
- New macro keyword: #warning
  add it at the top of your macro, and you will get warnings if there are undeclared variables used in it.

- /while and /for loops can now be nested inside each other.
- /continue and /break should work properly inside /for loops now.
- /continue and /break works in /while loops now.

- Updated MQ2Rez and MQ2Cast to not hog the cpu looking up windows over and over.
- Other stuff to optimize and cut down on cpu intensive tasks.

Files changed outside of core:
\MQ2Cast\MQ2Cast.cpp
\MQ2Rez\MQ2Rez.cpp

01 Sep 2017 by eqmule and eqholic
- You can now call functions inside if statements in your macros
  Use [] after your sub inside the if statement to tell the macro its a sub
  so /if (blah[]) /call dostuff
  or if it actually have parameters
  /if (blah[${arg1} "hi there" 0]) /call dostuff

  Example:
  [code]
Sub Testsub
    /echo Enter Testsub
    /return Hello world
/return

Sub Testargs(int arg1,int arg2)
    /if (${arg1} > ${arg2}) {
        /return Testargs: ${arg1} > ${arg2}
    } else {
        /return Testargs: ${arg1} <= ${arg2}
    }
/return

Sub IsHuuge(int arg1)
    /echo IsHuuge ${arg1} ?
    /if (${arg1} > 1000) {
        /echo TRUE
        /return TRUE
    } else {
        /echo FALSE
        /return FALSE
    }
/return

Sub Main 
    /echo ${Testsub[]}
    /echo ${Testargs[10 9]}
    /if (${IsHuuge[2000]} && !${IsHuuge[1]}) /echo Huuge and smaaal
/return
  [/code]

- Fixed Me.Aego and some other stuff related to it.
  Unfortunately for us and everyone else that parses the spells db
  Category and Subcategory are now 0 for all spells that cannot be scribed.
  Lets hope this was just a mistake and it will be reversed in a future patch.

- Me.Aura now returns a pAuraType cred: xowis
  Members: ID, Name, SpawnID
  Methods: Remove
- Me.Aura[] now accept partial matches

- Updated for TEST
- Improved AddAlias, RemoveAlias and the rest of the alias stuff.
  macros that use /addalias should notice a significant increase in performance.

03 Aug 2017 by SwiftyMUSE
- Updated /cast to cast the memorized rank of the spell when the rank is not given in the name.
- Fixed random crashes with /click when zoning.

31 Jul 2017 by eqmule
- /cast now takes an optional loc x y z argument useful for splashspells.
  Example: /cast "Reforming Splash" loc 123 456 789
  would cast the splash spell at that location...
  just doing a /cast "Reforming Splash" will cast it either on your targets location
  and if you have no target on your own location.

- Added IsSummoned to the spawn tlo, returns true/false if its a summoned being (pet for example)
- MQ2Template now (correcty) creates OnBeginZone & OnEndZone functions. - cred htw
- Distances in searchspawn now return the true 3D distance (instead of 2d distance)
- Added zLoc to searchspawn. cred ctaylor
  this means you can search location and zradius at a specific zloc.
  Example:
  /echo ${Spawn[npc loc 10 20 30 radius 20 zradius 15]}
  IF there is a npc within 20 radius of loc 10,20 AND within +-15 Z of 30 (so max 45 or min 15)
  THEN it will return that spawn...
  NOTE: You can still use ${Spawn[npc loc 10 20 radius 20 zradius 15]}
  like before this addition, and then it will just use YOUR Z (thats how it has worked up til now.)
  If you use the loc keyword and there is a NUMBER as parameter 3, it will ALWAYS be assumed its the z loc...
  IF there is NO NUMBER as the third parameter after loc, then its NOT a Z.
  Just to make this perfectly clear: ALWAYS specify the radius keyword AFTER your loc keyword, and you will
  be fine no matter if you feed it 2 or 3 args.
  Makes sense? yeah... right...

27 Jul 2017 by eqmule
- Polished up the window manager a bit, it was overdue.
  This means some plugins might break, but its easy to fix.
	Example:
	[code]PCSIDLWND* ppWnd = pWindowManager->pWindows;
	PCSIDLWND pWnd=*ppWnd;
	while (pWnd = *ppWnd)
	...
	[/code]
	becomes:
	[code]for(int i=0;i<pWindowManager->pWindows.Count;i++)
	{
		if (PCXWND pWnd = pWindowManager->pWindows[i]) {
		...
	[/code]

- Improved /face to mimic exactly how the client AI faces mobs.
  This means its looks very natural and smooth now.
  Please don't use /face fast anymore, it looks "bottish"
  and there is no good reason to use it.

19 Jul 2017 by eqmule
- Updated for LIVE
- The crash callback will once again produce dump files and zip them.
- Math.Rand now takes an optional min argument so you can get a random number between 2 variables.
  Example: /echo ${Math.Rand[5,10]}
  this would return a randum number between 5 and 10.
  You can still use the original just specifying the max.
  Example: ${Math.Rand[10]}
  in which case it behaves as before. (in this example, rand between 1 and 10) 

17 Jul 2017 by SwiftyMUSE
- Added ${Me.Beneficial}, ${Me.BASExxx} back into the source code.

14 Jun 2017 by eqmule
- Changed ${Switch.Distance} and  ${Switch.Distance3D} so they report distance to the switch outer bounds, not its center.
- Fixed /click left door to take character reach and door radius into account.
  This means doors that previously couldn't be opened because there was no way to get within 20 feet of them
  can now be opened (the plane of justice door in pot comes to mind)
  In retrospect it kinda makes sense that if a door radius is huge, you dont have to get as close to it to open it...
  Thanks to Derple reporting this bug.
- Doors that require lock picking can now be opened as well if you have lockpicks on your cursor.

- Fixed a bug in the new noparse ini thingy

01 May 2017 by The Undertaker
- ${Ini} now takes an optional 5th argument "noparse"
  This means you can now (finally) read ini settings into a variable without parsing the actual setting.
Example:
INIFILE:
[code]
[DPS]
DPSCondition1=${Me.XTarget[1].PctHPs} > 50
[/code]
[code]
Sub Main
	/declare DPSCondition1 string local
	/echo This is the actual setting for DPSCondition1 : ${Ini[MySettings.ini,DPS,DPSCondition1,NULL,noparse]}
	/varset DPS1Condition ${Ini[MySettings.ini,DPS,DPSCondition1,NULL,noparse]}

	|looping it here so you can see the condition actually changes as the xtarget mobs HP changes and no need 
	|for reading the ini over and over anymore... you're welcome...
:loop
	/echo ${DPSCondition1}
	/delay 1s
	/goto :loop
/return
[/code]

- Added a new TLO ${Range} which returns a pRangeType
  pRangeType has 2 members:
  Between which returns TRUE or FALSE
  and
  Inside which also returns TRUE or FALSE
  Usage Example:
  /echo ${Range.Inside[10,5:9]}
  which will return TRUE since 5 and 9 are both within the 10 range.
  /echo ${Range.Between[85,95:100]}
  which will return FALSE since 85 is not a number between 95 and 100

- Maintenance Update

21 Apr 2017 by Derple
- Added new #bind command for macros.
  Short Explaination, this allows you to execute macro sub routines.
  Long Explaination:
  Binds are triggered when a macro runs either:
  /varset or /echo or /call or if a Sub is executed.
#bind allows you to bind an ingame slash command to a macro function.
Before you had to do this with #events and capture text that you sent to yourself for example: 
#event SayMana "#*#SayManaPercent#*#"
Now you can do 
#bind SayMana /saymana
Instead of sending yourself the keyword you can just type /saymana and it will execute the function called "Sub Bind_SayMana"
Example:
[code]
| Old Way
| #event StartCoh "#*#COH --GRP--#*#"
| New Way you can now just type /coh or /bcaa //coh or /bct mage //coh
#bind StartCoh /coh

Sub CastSpell(string spellToCast)
    /declare delayTime int local 0
    /echo Casting: ${Target.Name} with ${spellToCast}
    /casting "${spellToCast}" -maxtries|5
    /call WaitCastFinish
/return

Sub Event_StartCoh
    /if ( ${Bool[${Me.Book["Call of the Hero"]}]} == FALSE ) {
        /echo I don't have COH - Bailing...
        /return
    }
 
    /declare i int local 0
    /declare GroupCount int local ${Group.Members}
    /for i 1 to ${GroupCount}
        /doevents
        /if ( ${Group.Member[${i}].Distance} > 50 ) {
            /target id ${Group.Member[${i}].ID}
            /call CastSpell "Call of the Hero"
        }
        /call WaitCastReady "Call of the Hero"
    /next i
/return

Sub Bind_StartCoh
    /call Event_StartCoh
/return

Sub Main
    :Loop
    /doevents
    /delay 1s
    /goto :Loo
/return
[/code]

- Updated for TEST
- Fixed a couple offsets that where wrong for LIVE.

19 Apr 2017 by Dr. Sneerstell
- Updated for LIVE
- ${Skill[someskill].Auto} returns true or false if the skill is set to use /autoskill on/off
- ${Me.AutoSkill[1]} returns a pSkillType
- ${Me.AutoSkill[2]} returns a pSkillType
- Example usage:
- ${Me.AutoSkill[1].Name} returns the name of whatever skill is set as the first autoskill.
- ${Me.AutoSkill[2].ID} returns the ID of whatever skill is set as the second autoskill.
- Fixed /items crash
- The previous change to the GROUNDITEM Struct member "ID", the renaming of it to "ItemPtr",
  caused a crash, and has been reverted.
- Reorganized skills a bit. NUM_SKILLS is now 0x64 (it always was) so change plugins if needed.

15 Apr 2017 by eqmule
- Fix for /ranged crash in the TEST build.
- The GROUNDITEM Struct member "ID" has been renamed to "ItemPtr". (just accept it)
  Added some missing members to that struct as well.

- Tip for macro authors:
- Added FloorZ to the Spawn TLO it returns a float.
  FloorZ usage: ok so... eh, spawns are sometimes (always?) "planted" a few inches below or above the floor...
  This member represent where the floor is ACTUALLY at.
  So if you for example do a /echo ${Target.Z} and it returns 219
  and then you do a ${Target.FloorZ} it will return like 216 or something...
  Why is this important, well for brainiacs new mq2nav, I discovered that
  sometimes, when a spawns z location is outside of the geometry... (above or below)
  you cannot just do a /nav target or a /nav locxyz ${Target.X} ${Target.Y} ${Target.Z}
  BUT doing a /nav locxyz ${Target.X} ${Target.Y} ${Target.FloorZ} works.
  So... this is how you get /nav working correctly with problematic spawns which have their feet outside of the geometry.

- Updated for LIVE
- XTARGETDATA has been renamed to XTARGETSLOT
- New include added SharedClasses.h
- the XTARGETSLOT struct has been moved to SharedClasses.h
- Unknown0x4 in the XTARGETSLOT struct has been renamed to XTargetSlotStatus, change plugins accordingly.
- XTarget stuff has gone through a make over, this will break plugins.
  Here are ONE example of how to fix this:
  MQ2Melee.cpp:
  change:
  [code]case XTaggro:
		{
			Dest.DWord = true;
			Dest.Type = pBoolType;
			if (PCHARINFO pChar = GetCharInfo()) {
				if (PXTARGETMGR xtm = pChar->pXTargetMgr) {

							{
								x++;
							}
						}
						if (x>1) {
							if (pAggroInfo) {
								for (DWORD i = 0; i<xtm->TargetSlots; i++) {
									if (DWORD spID = xta->pXTargetData[i].SpawnID) {
										if (PSPAWNINFO pSpawn = (PSPAWNINFO)GetSpawnByID(spID)) {
											if (pTarget && ((PSPAWNINFO)pTarget)->SpawnID == pSpawn->SpawnID)
												continue;
											if (pSpawn->Type == SPAWN_NPC && xta->pXTargetData[i].xTargetType == XTARGET_AUTO_HATER) {
												DWORD agropct = pAggroInfo->aggroData[AD_xTarget1 + i].AggroPct;
												//WriteChatf("Checking aggro on %s its %d",xta->pXTargetData[i].Name,agropct);
												if (agropct<100) {
													Dest.DWord = false;
													break;
												}
											}
										}
									}
								}
							}
						}
					}
				}
			}[/code]
			to
			[code]case XTaggro:
				{
					Dest.DWord = true;
					Dest.Type = pBoolType;
					if (PCHARINFO pChar = GetCharInfo()) {
						if (ExtendedTargetList *xtm = pChar->pXTargetMgr) {
							DWORD x = 0;
							for (int n = 0; n < xtm->XTargetSlots.Count; n++)
							{
								XTARGETSLOT xts = xtm->XTargetSlots[n];
								if (xts.xTargetType == XTARGET_AUTO_HATER && xts.XTargetSlotStatus)
								{
									x++;
								}
							}
							if (x > 1) {
								if (pAggroInfo) {
									for (int i = 0; i < xtm->XTargetSlots.Count; i++) {
										XTARGETSLOT xts = xtm->XTargetSlots[i];
										if (DWORD spID = xts.SpawnID) {

												if (pTarget && ((PSPAWNINFO)pTarget)->SpawnID == pSpawn->SpawnID)
													continue;
												if (pSpawn->Type == SPAWN_NPC && xts.xTargetType == XTARGET_AUTO_HATER) {
													DWORD agropct = pAggroInfo->aggroData[AD_xTarget1 + i].AggroPct;
													//WriteChatf("Checking aggro on %s its %d",xta->pXTargetData[i].Name,agropct);
													if (agropct < 100) {
														Dest.DWord = false;
														break;
													}
												}
											}
										}
									}
								}
							}
						}
					}
				}[/code]
- Good Luck.

13 Feb 2017 by derple
- Fixed ${Target.Buff[x].Caster} so it takes multiple casters of the same spell into account.
  Before this fix, only the first caster of a spell would be returned.
- Added ${Target.MyBuff[x]} it returns a pSpellType
  Example Usage:
  [code]holyshit0=/if (!${Debuff.Silenced} && ${Me.PctMana} > 10 && ${Target.MyBuff[Envenomed Breath].ID} == NULL && ${Target.CurrentHPs}<95) /casting "Envenomed Breath"[/code]
- Added ${Target.MyBuffCount} it returns a int of all buffs YOU have casted on the target.

08 Feb 2017 by eqmule
- Fixed a few places which would use pInvSlotMgr without NULL checking it
- Added .TimeBeenDead to the spawn tlo You can use it to figure out how long a corpse has been dead.
  NOTE: The timer is dependant on if you where in the zone when the corpse spawned.
  If you enter a zone and check this tlo member it will display the time of the death 
  as the time you entered the zone.
- Fixed a potential stack corruption in EndMacro
- Updated for TEST
- Made some changes to MacroQuest2.exe to deal with it not detecting eqgame version correctly sometimes.

03 Feb 2017 by eqmule
- Updated for TEST, yes there was a new patch.
- Fixed a issue that would hang the client and sometimes even crash it.
  this should fix the problem with using Untamed Rage on a berserker
  as well as other buff stacking check problems.

03 Feb 2017 by eqmule
- Updated for latest LIVE and TEST patches

01 Feb 2017 by eqmule
- Crash handling is now somewhat configurable

- Added Start EQBC Server to the tray icon menu.

29 Jan 2017 by eqmule
- I finally had time to sit down and look at the crash reporting
  it has been given a major overhaul
  you will know what I mean next time you crash.
  Please READ the crash message carefully.
  Do what it says. Or not.

  GetCastingTimeModifier, GetFocusCastingTimeModifier, GetFocusRangeModifier, HasSkill, MakeMeVisible.
- Corrected a bug in BuffStackTest when checking triggering spas.

13 Jan 2017 by SwiftyMUSE
- Added SkillBase to character. This will give you the static base maximum for your skills.
- Updated Skill and SkillCap to handle the new TS aas allowing for above the cap values.

13 jan 2017 by eqmule
- Added ${Macro.MemUse} it returns a pIntType letting u know how much memory your macro is using.
  its useful if you suspect you have a leak.
- Ok so here is a NEW FEATURE which was brought to us by Brainiac, Thanks Brainiac!
  It allows us to extend any existing TLO's in our own plugins.
  Example:
  You want to add a new member to for example the character TLO
  named .CursorKrono which tells you how many Krono you have on your cursor
  you could then do /echo ${Me.CursorKrono}

  Below is a plugin example for how you would do this: (tags added for forum post to show up correctly)
[CODE]
// MQ2ExtensionTest.cpp : Defines the entry point for the DLL application.
//

// PLUGIN_API is only to be used for callbacks.  All existing callbacks at this time
// are shown below. Remove the ones your plugin does not use.  Always use Initialize
// and Shutdown for setup and cleanup, do NOT do it in DllMain.


#include "../MQ2Plugin.h"

	{
		TypeMember(CursorKrono);
	}
	bool GETMEMBER()
	{
		PMQ2TYPEMEMBER pMember = FindMember(Member);
		if (!pMember)
			return false;
		switch (pMember->ID)
		{
			case CursorKrono:
			{
				if(PCHARINFO pCharInf = GetCharInfo()) {
					Dest.DWord = pCharInf->CursorKrono;
					Dest.Type = pIntType;

06 Jan 2017 by eqmule
- Fixed the _EQCASTSPELLGEM struct, thanks JimBob
  this should make features that relies on the spellicon and spellstate members of that struct work again.
- Updated the TEST build so its synced with LIVE.
- Added some new Spawn TLO members: (DISCLAIMER:  I reserve the right to remove/alter and or depreciate any of these as I'm still testing this stuff.)
	IsBerserk (pBoolType), pTouchingSwitch (pIntType), bShowHelm (pBoolType), CorpseDragCount (pIntType), bBetaBuffed (pBoolType), CombatSkillTicks[x] 0-1 (pIntType), 
	FD (pIntType), InPvPArea (pBoolType), bAlwaysShowAura (pBoolType), GMRank (pIntType), WarCry (pIntType), IsPassenger (pBoolType), 
	LastCastTime (pIntType), DragNames[x] 0-1 (pStringType), DraggingPlayer (pStringType), bStationary (pBoolType), BearingToTarget (pFloatType), bTempPet (pBoolType), 
	HoldingAnimation (pIntType), Blind (pIntType), LastCastNum (pIntType), CollisionCounter (pIntType), CeilingHeightAtCurrLocation (pFloatType), AssistName (pStringType), 
	SeeInvis[x] 0-2 (pIntType), SpawnStatus[x] 0-5 (pIntType), bWaitingForPort (pBoolType)

- SolventNeeded in the iteminfo struct has been renamed to SolventItemID 
- Added some new members to the iteminfo struct and cleaned it up a little.
- Added MQ2AugType TLO, it has these members: Slot (pIntType), Type (pIntType), Visible (pBoolType), Infusable (pBoolType), Empty (pBoolType), Name (pStringType), Item (pItemType)
- New Member: AugSlot added to the item TLO 
  it returns a pAugType
  Usage: (Items can have MAX 6 slots for augs so... [x] can ONLY be 0-5)
        /echo ${Cursor.AugSlot[0].Type}
        /echo ${Cursor.AugSlot[1].Visible}
        /echo ${Cursor.AugSlot[2].Infusable}
        /echo ${Cursor.AugSlot[3].Empty}
        /echo ${Cursor.AugSlot[4].Name}
        /echo ${Cursor.AugSlot[5].Item.Purity}
- Added 2 new commands: /removeaug and /insertaug to the mq2itemdisplay plugin
  type /removeaug or /insertaug for help
  /removeaug will pop a dialog if a perfect augmentation distiller needs to be used...
  I would be extremely careful with these 2 commands unless you understand
  how they work... if you augment the wrong item or remove an augment from the wrong item or whatever... its not my fault.
- Added the MQ2WorldLocationType TLO it has the following members: ID (pIntType),Y (pFloatType), X (pFloatType), Z (pFloatType),Heading (pFloatType), Zone (pZoneType),
- Added BoundLocation to the Charatcer TLO its size is 0-4 for up to 5 bind points.
  Usage:
		 /echo ${Me.BoundLocation[0].ID} returns the zone id of your first bind point
		 /echo ${Me.BoundLocation[1].ID} returns the zone id of your second bind point
- Changed pChar2->ZoneBoundX it's now pChar2->BoundLocations[0].ZoneBoundX; 
          as well as all the other ->ZoneBo****** members.

20 Dec 2016 by eqmule
- Updated for TEST

18 Dec 2016 by eqmule
- OK ILL PUT THIS FIRST SO YOU DON'T MISS IT:
- I have changed ALL instances of GuildID to __int64 (cause DBG did)
  PLEASE! be aware of this change as it WILL break some plugins.
  NOW, as for macros: IF your macros uses ${Me.GuildID} NOTE that it returns a pInt64Type
  from now on.
  This is the reason I have added 2 new members to the pInt64Type TLO
  Namely: .LowPart and .HighPart
  SO: IF you have a macro that relies on GuildID being 4 bytes...
  Then you NEED to change it from: ${Me.GuildID} to ${Me.GuildID.LowPart}
  mkay...
- Now onto the fixes:
- FIX: /pet attack <id>
- FIX: barter and trader "tells" no longer trigger beepontells
- FIX: /mqclear no longer crashes
- FIX: /itemnotify "name of item" lefmouseup can pick up
  items from top level slots once again.
- For completeness sake I also added .LowPart and .HighPart to the pIntType TLO

15 Dec 2016 by eqmule
- Fix: double timestamps in the eqlog is no longer happening so you can turn on /timestamp again.
- Fixed a bug in FindItem and its derivatives where it needed signed parameters.
- Fixed the EQINVSLOTWND struct, it was off by a few bytes.
  Yes that means .InvSlot will once again "work" (dont effing use it. in your macros, use ItemSlot and ItemSlot2)

14 Dec 2016 by eqmule
- GuildID in SPAWNINFO is a __int64 now... not by my design, it just is
  I have tried to make it backwards compaible with the spawn guild tlo which is still a DWORD
  report any bugs related to this change on the forum. Plugins are gonna have to be updated accodingly.
- Fix Errors like this for example: error C2660: 'GetGuildByID': function does not take 1 arguments
  char  *pGuild = GetGuildByID( GetCharInfo()->GuildID ); becomes
  LARGE_INTEGER guildlarge = {0};
  guildlarge.QuadPart = GetCharInfo()->GuildID;
  char  *pGuild = GetGuildByID( guildlarge.LowPart,guildlarge.HighPart );

- I started correcting the iteminfo struct it's a work in progress so expect more changes to fully implement this.
- Initially the Augment members has gotten a review (and a fix since they where broken)
- So... AugSlot1 etc is now part of its own class
- therefor:
- pitem->AugSlot1 is now pitem->AugData.Sockets[0].Type
- and so on...
- pitem->AugSlot1_Visible is now pitem->AugData.Sockets[0].bVisible
- and so on...
- CListWnd no longer inherits CSidlScreenWnd BUT it has access to the CXWnd class members.
- CComboWnd no longer inherits CSidlScreenWnd BUT it has access to the CXWnd class members.
  Fix Errors like these:
  list->Items becomes list->ItemsArray.Count
  CListWnd*pListWnd = (CListWnd*)pCombo->Items becomes CListWnd*pListWnd = pCombo->pListWnd (it was kinda confusing before, but less so after this change)

13 Dec 2016 by SwiftyMUSE
- Updated GetClassesFromMask to display "ALL" or "ALL EXCEPT:" when appropriate based on the class
  mask.

08 Dec 2016 by eqmule
- Updated for TEST
- Fixed a bug where FindItem and all its derivatives wouldn't look deeper than 20 slots into a bag.
  Now it doesn't matter how many slots a bag has, it is dynamic.
- I #pragma pack(8) where I need it now, dont change them.
- In preparation for automatic updating of the CONTENTS struct
-  I HAD to reorganise it.
-  Therefor:
-	NumOfSlots1 has been renamed to ContentSize Ths also effects macros that use the NumOfSlots1 member.
-	NumOfSlots2 has been renamed to Size

-	MOST of these changes affect core only, I dont think there will be many plugins that needs updating
-	BUT here are some examples of how to fix errors that I have seen:
-	change:
-	pItem->ItemSlot TO pItem->GlobalIndex.Index.Slot1
-	cSlot->pContentsArray TO cSlot->Contents.ContainedItems.pItems
-	cSlot->pContentsArray->Contents[iPack] to cSlot->GetContent(iPack)
-	pInvSlot->pContentsArray TO pInvSlot->Contents.ContainedItems.pItems
-	pInvSlot->pContentsArray->Contents[ucPack] TO EITHER:
-	pInvSlot->Contents.ContainedItems.pItems->Item[ucPack] OR SIMPLY JUST
-	pInvSlot->GetContent(ucPack) BOTH return the exact same thing.

06 Dec 2016 by SwiftyMUSE
- Fixed up the new SPA descriptions in spell display

28 Nov 2016 by eqmule
- Fixed ${Me.ManaRegen}
- CButtonWnd now inherits CXWnd (cause it does).
- GetItemTimerValue has been renamed to GetItemRecastTimer
- Removed ManaGained, HealthGained, EnduranceGained from Pulse() and the exports.
  Use GetEnduranceRegen(), GetHPRegen() and GetManaRegen() instead.
  This change should make Pulse() a bit faster since we dont check that stuff constantly.

20 Nov 2016 by SwiftyMUSE
- Fixed bug waiting for familiars keyring to load

19 Nov 2016 by SwiftyMUSE/eqmule
- Updated for TEST

  Thanks to william12 for reporting these bugs.

16 Nov 2016 by eqmule
- Updated for LIVE
- Reorganized SPAWNINFO to reflect how its laid out in memory.
- Feet in Spawninfo has been renamed to FloorHeight
- AvatarHeight2 in Spawninfo has been renamed to Width
- HoldingType in Spawninfo has been renamed to HoldingAnimation
- InnateETA in Spawninfo is now part of SpellGemETA as its LAST member because... well it should be.
- GetMeleeRangeVar2 has been renamed to MeleeRadius
- Class in the spawninfo struct has been moved to its correct location which is inside ActorClient.
  Therefor: (and I know people will post even though the answer is right here)
  ITS NOT pSpawn->Class anymore, its now pSpawn->mActorClient.Class
  same thing goes for Race.
  pSpawn->mPlayerPhysicsClient.Levitate instead of pSpawn->Levitate
  pSpawn->mPlayerPhysicsClient.pSpawn instead of  pSpawn->pSpawn

- mkay...

14 Nov 2016 by eqmule
- Updated for BETA
- GetSpellEffectNameByID fixed to not return a temp buffer - cred HTW
- ReadWindowINI in MQ2AdvPath correctly read the ini but never set the window value
  this has been corrected - cred Brainiac
  a zip which has the corrected version in it is located here : http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=11451&p=172713#p172713

- Corrected the zoneinfo struct 
  What we previously had been refering to as "ZoneType" was not in fact it, so it has been renamed to FOgOnOff which is what its for.
  This means that ${Zone.Type} has changed a bit...
  it now returns 0-5 see the EOutDoor enum for more info. And whoever wants to update the wiki should refer to that.
  in short: 0=Indoor Dungeon 1=Outdoor 2=Outdoor City 3=Dungeon City 4=Indoor City 5=Outdoor Dungeon

- Updated for BETA
- In preparation for the expansion on the 16th and for future faster patching,
  THE FOLLOWING STUFF has undergone some serious changes:
  You have 5 days to adjust your personal builds and plugins.

- BGColor is now a COLORREF change plugins accordingly.
  and no, it CANNOT be changed back to a ARGBCOLOR since that contains a union with bytes and that screws up the 4 aligned padding.
- UnknownCW has been renamed to CRNormal change plugins accordingly.
- Locked is now a bool
- TimeMouseOver has been renamed to FadeDelay
- dShow is now a bool
- We are using 4 byte alignemnt from now on, set ur plugins to 4 byte alignment.
- ONE MORE TIME, WE ARE NOT USING 1 byte ALIGNMENT ANYMORE.
- the CXWnd struct grew somewhat to make patching of it easier for me.
- Fixed a bug in MQ2EQBC that would crash u on /unload
- The following plugins has had changes made to them:
	MQ2AvdPath.cpp
	MQ2DPSAdv.cpp
	MQ2EQBC.cpp
	MQ2Melee.cpp
	MQ2MoveUtils.cpp
	MQ2Spawns.cpp
- They are located in this post: http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=11451&p=172713#p172713

- Updated RankName to find an exact match for name. The results from Spell.ID and Spell.RankName will now be
  from the same spell (if it exists in the spellbook).

- Added CharSelectList to the EverQuest TLO, it only has 1 member for now: ZoneID
  it returns the zoneid the character is currently in.
  Usage: /echo Im at charsselect and ${Window[CharacterListWnd].Child[CLW_Character_List].List[1,3]} is in ${EverQuest.CharSelectList[1].ZoneID}
  Output:  (if a char named Eqmule is the first in your charlist) Im at charselect and Eqmule is in 202
  OR:
  /echo Im at charsselect and Eqmule is in ${EverQuest.CharSelectList[Eqmule].ZoneID}
  Output: same as above.

- Updated for BETA
- I had a lot to do and it was difficult to get this working, so it's not tested properly.

- Added fellowship to the spawnsearch tlo - Idea Cred: mwilliam
  Example usage:
   /if ${SpawnCount[fellowship loc ${Me.X} ${Me.Y} radius 50]} >= 3) {
		/echo its ok to place a campfire now.
   } else {
		/echo not enough fellowship members here to place a campfire right now
   }
- RemoveBuff now accepts buffnames that are quoted "some buff"
- pinstCSystemInfoDialogBox HAS BEEN RENAMED TO pinstCLargeDialogWnd cause thats what it is.
- /loginchar server:charname will now launch eq and log the char in.
  NOTE: if you run this command and server:char is already running, you will kill his game and
  he will be logged in again, this command ALWAYS launches a new client.
  this is for advanced users only, I use it personally to launch and get back into a game when 
  one of my clients has crashed. (easily detected with the ${Group.Member[soandso].Offline} tlo member... or lets say I havent seen the guy for 15 minutes)
  NOTE2: this command only works if you are using the mq2 login system and have a profile for the character.
  Example: /loginchar tunare:eqmule
  will search all mq2 profile sets for the tunare server and the char eqmule
  if it finds it, it will launch eq and log in that character.
- The ~ key should now be able to cycle full screen windows and in order - SwiftyMUSE

18 Sep 2016 by eqmule
Sunday is funday... so here is some fluff:
- Added a "Boss Mode" hotkey, alt+~, (alt+tilde) if u click that all your eq windows will be instantly hidden. It's a toggle.
  the hotkey can be changed in the [MacroQuest] section, the value is called BossMode=
  setting BossMode=0 disables it.
- You can now "cycle" eq windows now with the '~' key.... (also known as tilde)
  its not obvious but you CAN change it by editing the macroquest.ini
  in the [MacroQuest] section add a CycleNextWindow=somekey
  Example: (and this is what it defaults to when this entry does not exist)
           CycleNextWindow=shift+`
  u can do alt+ and ctrl+ as well but thats it.
  you cannot combine alt+shift+, i didnt want to make this to complex.
  you CAN however drop the prefixes altogether and just specify it as
  CycleNextWindow=b
  that would make the lettere "b" on your keyboard cycle the windows... (not recommended unless u plan on never using the letter b for any other reason...)
  Setting CycleNextWindow=0 will disable it completely.
----- fluff end -----
- /loadspells no longer "loads them" even when a load technically isn't needed. -code cred: Vyco Dynn
- Fixed a bug related to keyring locations.

16 Sep 2016 by eqmule
- Fixed a crash bug in listwnd::addstring for the test build -report cred: fry
- ISXEQ once again compiles... sorry about the long wait.
  BIG NOTE: it now includes ISXDK 35, this means you should use VS 2015 with toolset 140 to build it.
  one thing though... mq2ic doesnt load for some reason for it
  I have contacted Lax and hope we can figure out a workaround.
  Bottomline... yeah... you CAN build isxeq now...
  but its not protected by mq2ic, so run at your own risk.
  I really didnt want to wait any longer to get something out.
  but if you are the paranoid type, id hold off a couple more days
  until we can figure out a way to load it...

15 Sep 2016 by eqmule
- Updated for TEST
- The Loader now detects if a profile is loaded or not and reloads if needed if clicked,
  prior to this update sessions that u did /unload in game for had their profile name set
  as character (Loaded) and if you clicked such a profile, it would not reload.
- Fixed a bug in GetItemContentsByName
- Fixed a bug in GetItemLink -cred demonstar55 and SwiftyMUSE
- Added a new parameter to FindItemBySlot so we can specify which locations to search.
- NEW FEATIRE: The EverQuest TLO has a new member .LastMouseOver
  it returns a windowtype of the last window the mouse was hovering.
  Want to know the name of a window or its children? Tired of doing /windows and look through a list of a million windows?
  Well now it's easy:
  Example: Place the mouse over a window and do a /echo ${EverQuest.LastMouseOver.Name}
  Example2: /echo ${EverQuest.LastMouseOver.Tooltip}
- NEW FEATURE: Added .MouseOver to the Group TLO
  Usage1: /echo Im hovering my mouse over ${Group.MouseOver.Name} which has ths spawnid: ${Group.MouseOver.ID}
  Usage2: /bct ${Group.MouseOver.Name} hi there I dont want to change my target just to tell u: please heal ${Me.Mame}
  Usage3: /bct eqmule //casting "Complete Heal" -targetid|${Group.MouseOver.ID}
  Usage4: /bct ${Group.MouseOver.CleanName} //setprio 2
  Final Note: YOU CAN hover over your own name in the player window where u see your hp and it will return you.
  There are many more usages for this im sure...
- Fixed GetItemLink
- Fixed AltAbilityReady to only return true for active abilities - cred desgn
- Fixed multiple buffer overflows all over the place in core.
- Note to self:
  The following plugins has had some kind of modification made to them to work with this release:
  MQ2Twist, MQ2SpawnMaster, MQ2LinkDB, MQ2EQBC I should post them on the forum.
  NavigationType.cpp MQ2Netheal.cpp MQ2SpawnMaster.cpp MQ2Twist.cpp


02 Sep 2016 by eqmule
- Reverted a "fix" to the /while command that instead of fixing it made it worse
  im not happy with this command, im gonna have to spend more time on it.

01 Sep 2016 by eqmule
- Misc Fixes to improve stability.
- The Launcher can now launch single sessions without logging u in, i basically just "launches clean"
  rightclick the "Launch Clean" menu item to toggle starting eqgame in suspended mode (for power users)
- The Launcher can now export and import login profiles.
- Added some missing itemtypes.
- The ALTABILITY struct has gotten an overhaul
  CurrentRank is now GroupLevel
  RequirementCount is now RequiredGroups
  RequiresAbility is now RequiredGroupLevels
  grant_only is now QuestOnly
  next_id is now NextGroupAbilityId
  last_id is now PreviousGroupAbilityId
  PointsSpent is now TotalPoints
- PLUGIN AUTHORS: GetAAById has a second parameter, its level, use it or it will default to -1 this is only important when you try to find a aa by name.
	example:
	int level = -1;
	if (PSPAWNINFO pMe = (PSPAWNINFO)pLocalPlayer) {
		level = pMe->Level;
	}
	if (PALTABILITY pAbility = pAltAdvManager->GetAAById(index, level)) {
- I added a wrapper for GetAAById so we can build emu builds.
  its called GetAAByIdWrapper and is exported.

- CTargetWnd__UpdateBuffs is now CTargetWnd__RefreshTargetBuffs (cause it is)
- Bunch of other stuff

17 Aug 2016 by eqmule
- Updated for LIVE
- TRUEBOX nerfed.

15 Aug 2016 by SwiftyMUSE
- Updated to include CreateHtmlWnd in base code. You can now load MQ2Web and MQ2NoNag in the same session.

12 Aug 2016 by eqmule
- Updated for TEST
- EzDetour is now EzDetourwName all EzDetour( calls should be replaced to use the new EzDetourwName
  I did this because debugging /unload crashes is much easier now.
  EzDetour is still in the compile for awhile to give everyone time for the transition but expect it to be gone in due time.
- Misc updates, fixed a bug in macroquest2.exe which would prevent loading profiles that where not checked.
  made edit and delete work on (Loaded) profiles
- Fixed a bug in mq2autologin which would prevent it from working correctly if eqmain was already loaded on its initialization.
- TRUEBOX will not load mq2eqbc, mq2cast, mq2moveutils or mq2melee anymore. It proved to be to much of an nuisance to me and other players.
  And frankly too much negative attention is bad for mq2 as well. I'll take full responsibility for what went down, and I dont want that again.
  We didn't create mq2 to get people banned, we created it to add utility.
  TRUEBOX is likely to be scrapped altogether on the 17th although i might resurrect it in another form in the future.
  BUT IF we ever go down this path again, expect only utility like audio triggers and maybe a dpsparser, think GINA and gamparse etc.

9 Aug 2016
- Added .LayoutCopyInProgress to the EverQuest TLO
  it returns TRUE if a layoutcopy is in progress and FALSE if not.
- Fixed a couple buffer overflow bugs.
- Misc stuff.

8 Aug 2016 by eqmule
- The integrity checker is now 714% faster (or something).
- Updated mq2autologin, its not going to crash you ever again (well in theory at least)
  So, look, mq2autologin has been overhauled, and I also figured out where the serverids
  are being stored, this means that from now on you can place server shortnames in the mq2autologin.ini
  and as long as they have a server LONGNAME that matches what you see in the server select list it will be able to log you in.
  This is particularly useful on emulator login servers that assign dynamic IDs.
  NOTE2: for live servers, like tunare and drinal for example, those really ARE the real shortnames so I use those.
         BUT for emu servers, I have no idea what their shortanmes are, sometimes they dont even use a "short name", but instead, they use like a really long one with
		 spaces in it and so on, so I HIGHLY recommend you stick to a short name with no spaces in it, especially IF you are using the new MQ2 login feature on
		 the tray icon because eqgame only accepts 30 character commandlines so having a really long "shortname" will definaltely break that type of login for you...
		 bottomline, the mq2 login feature doesn't really care if the shortname is fake or real, it will use whatever is in your profile when it look them up in the ini.
  NOTE3: for live and test servers, obviously the static id of those servers is still valid, and mq2autologin will still be able to look those up internally
  like it always have, this new ini setting is mainly for emu servers, but you can of course add any server u like, even live ones.
  so without further ado here is an:
    Example of a [Servers] section in mq2autologin.ini (note that I have no idea if these servers even allow mq2, this is just an example)
	[Servers]
	tunare=Tunare - The Seventh Hammer
	drinal=Drinal - Maelin Starpyre
	firiona=Firiona Vie (Roleplaying Preferred)
	peqtgc=[] [PEQ]The Grand Creation [legit-god]
	ezserv=[] EZ Server - Custom Zones, Vendors, Quests, Items, etc
	stormhav=[] Storm Haven - High-Quality Custom Content
	alkabor=[] The Al'Kabor Project [www.takproject.net]

25 Jul 2016 by eqmule
- THE BIG #pragma warnings SHOULD DIE patch...
- I have removed the #pragma warnings for depreciated string functions.
- This will absolutely break ALL your plugins.
- I am available on skype to help you fix every single one. eq.mule
- This is NOT going to be easy, but I have posted updated plugins
  on macroquest2.com in every thread that I had plugin source for.
- When you get WARNINGS while buidling this version, IT MEANS, you need a fix.
- DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT ADD A PRAGMA TO FIX IT
- I'm seriously going to go ballistic if i see any more #pragma warnings
  If a #pragam warning is needed we are doing it wrong.

- So... the whambulance will be comming for sure when you update to this version.
  Sorry about that, but it was needed because I'm sick of all the buffer overflows
  that are crashing us randomly and I can never get a good call stack in order to fix them.
  This fix is years overdue, and I consider it crucial in order to move forward
  towards a 100% stable mq2.

- Anyway... I made a whole bunch of stuff stringsafe
  too much to list, if u have plugins that wont build
  post about it or message me and ill help u fix them.
  Here is a link to a post that has all my personal versions of the plugins I use, that I have fixed for this release:
- http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=20053
- pMQ2Blech is no longer an export, create your own Blechs, cause hooking into that one is no longer an option.
  (this means mq2moveutils need to be updated see above link for updated plugins.)

13 Jul 2016
- Updated for LIVE
- Updated for TRUEBOX
  Yes... you can probably bypass my code thats in place to make a TRUEBOX version that
  has all the stuff the LIVE one has, but I am appealing to your decency now.
  Please dont. We have a good thing going with dbg now and I hate to see that ruined by someone
  for their own personal gain. -eqmule
- 
- To build a TRUEBOX version of mq2, uncomment //TRUEBOX in mq2main.
- If I find out that people are abusing this newfound power, I WILL have no other choice than
  moving more stuff into mq2ic, please dont make me do that. I like to keep mq2 as open
  as possible.

12 Jul 2016
- Updated for TEST
- winter is comming.

06 Jul 2016
- Updated for LIVE
- You can now enable/disable MQ2login from the tasktray menu.

02 Jul 2016
- Added a check for "You have a character logged into a world server as an OFFLINE TRADER from this account" to mq2autologin
- Added a check for "failed login attempts on your account since the last time you logged in."  to mq2autologin
- Added a check for "This login requires that the account be activated.  Please make sure your account is active in order to login"  to mq2autologin
- Added a check for "Error - A timeout occurred"  to mq2autologin

- Added a setting for the "Trade when you have something on the cursor and click on the name of the target in the target window" feature
  its in macroquest.ini as UseTradeOnTarget. default is 1. (on)

01 Jul 2016
- Updated for TEST
- The Create new Profile window no longer closes after u create a profile.
  you can close it on the [X] when you are done adding profiles, this was a requested feature.
- To celebrate that it looks like we are getting all our accounts back, I decided to comply with some users requests
  so I:
- Added a popupmenu to the Profilemenu on the trayicon
  you can now rightclick the profile and you will see Edit, Delete and Check/Uncheck
  The browse button is active now as well.
  Happy Boxing!, this should make it easier.

30 Jun 2016
- Updated for TEST
- Updated MQ2AutoLogin.cpp - cred: derple.
- Updated Blech - cred derple
  change was done to fix a crash in blech.
- Fixed Spell Dmg in MQ2ItemDisplay - cred: dewey2461
- Misc Stuff to improve stability.
- Changed the way Profile for Login works, you will need to recreate your profiles. -cred: dewey2461
  Im really sorry about that, but its better we get this done now than in 6 months
  when it will affect more people.
  This is new feature to me as well, and im doing my best to make it work the way people want it,
  based on the feedback I get.
  The good news is, next version will have a browse to path button (that works)
  an edit and a delete option for the profiles, this change lays the groundwork for that.

28 Jun 2016
- MQ2AutoLogin is now part of the core zip
- NEW FEATURE: Profiled Logins:
	Basically it's a new menu on the task icon called Profiles.
	The first time you click it you will see a Create New... menu item.
	You click it and a small window asking for 5 things will pop up.
	Server, login, pass, character name and path to eqgame.exe
	Once you have that filled in you click an OK button and your profile will be encrypted and saved in mq2autologin.ini
	You can save as many profiles as you want and they will sort per server on the menu.
	Each server profile has a Load/Unload All option so once you have added all your accounts for a server you just click the Load All and away it goes,
	it will login all of the characters under that server. (Well all that are check marked)

- Check marks: each character can be marked for loading by simply right clicking the character name to toggle it marked on or off.

- Loading individual accounts:
	You just left click on a character name and if it is check marked, it will load and the name will be changed to <Charname> (Loaded)

- Unloading individual accounts:
	If a char is loaded and has the text (Loaded) behind it you just left click it to unload.
	I kept this as simple as I possibly could so its a Toggle.

- I can add window positioning and stuff I guess but for now it's just a easy way to login a box team on a server.

- Batch Files and hotkeys:
	If you currently use batch files or hotkeys or whatever, those should still be usable if you don't want to click the menu.
	Example: (this example assumes you HAVE profiles created with "Create New..." in mq2autologin.ini)
	Batch file can launch your accounts by sending the server_charname to the eqgame client like this: <path to eqgame.exe> patchme /login:drinal_eqmule
	And that's really all there is to it... You would of course change the server and Charname to your server and your char (drinal and eqmule)

- Encryption:
	I strongly recommend getting this setup though, because it encrypts your password in a way that in "theory" makes it only decryptable on YOUR computer,
	this means that even if you accidently post your mq2autologin.ini somewhere, or someone gets hold of it, the information inside it will be useless to them.
-	Finally, no, you don't "HAVE" to use this feature, mq2autologin is backwards compatible to handle any old way you feel more comfortable with.


22 Jun 2016
- Updated for LIVE
- Updated for TEST
- BeepOnTells and FlashOnTells fixed to not beep and flash on pet tells.
- Added .ScreenMode to the EverQuest TLO, it returns the ScreenMode as a integer.
- Added a new command: /screenmode which sets the screenmode.
  Usage: /screenmode <#> Where 2 is Normal and 3 is No Windows
  This is experimental, I noticed you can decrease the memory footprint by setting it to 3 and then back to 2
  in 3 only the main window is drawn and I suspect memory gets freed then.

17 Jun 2016
- Added .PPriority to the EverQuest TLO, it returns the Process Priority as a string.
- Added a new command: /setprio which sets process priority (like in Task Manager)
  Usage: /setprio <1-6>
  Where 1 is Low 2 is below Normal 3 is Normal 4 is Above Normal 5 is High and 6 is RealTime
  Example: You need to build something quick in Visual Studio
  just do a /bcga //setprio 2 and it will zoom by real fast.
- Added .Corrupted and .Cursed to the Me. and Target. TLO's

16 Jun 2016
- Fixed the ISXEQ build errors.
- Fixed a few arrays related bugs:
- ${Me.Book[0]} will now return NULL again instead of assuming the macro author meant ${Me.Book[1]}.
  This fix should make macros and some plugins that relied on NULL returns for invalid tlo member usage work again.
  (hint: there is no such thing as ${Me.Book[0]} all macro arrays start at 1... but whatever...)
- Fixed a /unload crash in mq2autologin
  it has been posted here: http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=16427

15 Jun 2016
- Updated for LIVE
- Added xtarhater to the spawnsearch tlo - Idea Cred: Maskoi
  Example usage:
   /if (${SpawnCount[npc xtarhater loc ${Target.X} ${Target.Y} radius ${Spell[Deadening Wave Rk. II].AERange}]} >= ${SpawnCount[npc loc ${Target.X} ${Target.Y} radius ${Spell[Deadening Wave Rk. II].AERange}]}) {
		/echo its ok to cast the aemez it wont aggro more mobs than whats on xtarget.
		/casting "Deadening Wave Rk. II"
   } else {
		/echo if you cast your aemez now, you will agro more mobs than are on your xtarget, which would be stupid.
		/casting "Bewilder Rk. II"
   }
- Fixed a bug in .RankName which would cause it to return the wrong spell.

10 Jun 2016
- .MyCastTime in the spell TLO is now a timestamptype (cause it is)
  OK FINE... LOOK THESE THINGS WILL BREAK "SOME" MACROS:
  Since I changed all these recast and cast timers and so on in the last few days
  A LOT of macros will break...
  Sorry about that but these timers should never have been floats in the first place
  and we better get this done now or it will cause problems down the road for us, when we add new stuff.
  TO DEAL WITH THIS I have Added .Raw to the timestamp TLO it will just output total milliseconds
  And IF you really need the old Float output I also added .Float
  this will allow you to still see things as floats if that's what you prefered.
  Example: /echo ${Me.Book[1].MyCastTime.Float}
  Output: 1.50

09 Jun 2016
- Updated for TEST (yes really)
- Added .DurationValue1 to the Spell TLO
- Changed the way /unload and re/inject works, those things are now part of the Processgame detour
  that should prevent some crashes related to us interfering with the window drawing.
  In fact direct calls to eqgame functions from mq2start or any other thread is asking for trouble.
  This change should minimize that behaviour.
- .CastTime in the spell TLO is now a timestamptype (cause it is)
- .RecoveryTime in the spell TLO is now a timestamptype (cause it is)
- .FizzleTime in the spell TLO is now a timestamptype (cause it is)

  See yesterdays changes for an example of usage using .RecastTime

09 Jun 2016 by SwiftyMUSE
- Additional updates for spell effects

08 Jun 2016
- Sorry TEST players this update is NOT for todays TEST patch. Expect one tomorrow.
- Added .IsSkill to the spell tlo
- Fixed a crash in Me.CombatAbility when doing ${Me.CombatAbility[0]}
- Fixed some potential crashes that could occur because of signed/unsigned integer misuse.
- Added .DoOpen and .DoClose Methods to the Window TLO
  Usage: /echo ${Window[somewindow].Child[somechild].DoOpen}
  Expected Result: it will echo TRUE and open it.
- Addded .NumGems to the character TLO it returns the number of spellgems you currently have.
  Usage: /echo ${Me.NumGems}
  Expected output for a level 1 character: 8
  Expected output for a level 105 character which has Mnemonic Retention AA at rank 4: 12
- .RecastTime in the spell TLO is now a timestamptype (cause it is)
  Usage: /echo ${Spell[Steadfast Stance Rk. II].RecastTime.TotalSeconds}
  Expected Output: 150

01 Jun 2016
- fixed a bug that would always return NULL instead of TRUE or FALSE
when doing ${AdvLoot.SList[x].AlwaysGreed} - cred hoosierbilly

- /echo now accepts colorcodes -cred htw see http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=17141&p=152508#p152508
- Fixed a few bugs related to aa indexes.
- Dont make a big thing out of this but:
- /caption now takes a new argument "anon"
  You can use this to anonymize your session.
  It was brought to my attention that there was an interest in recording/streaming video - cred: maskoi
  while at the same time protecting the privacy of the player as well as other players.
  NOTE 1: This is cosmetic and LOCAL only, in other words NOT AN ACTIVE HACK.
  NOTE 2: You are NOT anonymous to other players OR the server.
  NOTE 3: I recommend leaving this option OFF at all times unless you really need to use it, because it WILL use a lot of cpu time.
  NOTE 4: The mq2labels plugin need to be loaded for the "full anonymity effect".
  NOTE 5: Chat is NOT anonymized at all. Although if people want that, we can certainly make it happen in a future update.
  Usage: /caption anon on
- And finally see changes for test in changes below from 13 May 2016, they apply to LIVE now as well.

	Its unlikely that these will return, but I will know in a few days when I have had more time to investigate this.
	I *MIGHT* create wrapper functions for these values like ((EQ_Item*)pItem)->GetAccuracy();.
	BUT IF YOU HAVE PLUGINS OR MACROS THAT USE THESE VALUES: //Comment them out for now...
	I will know more before this stuff gets pushed to the LIVE client next week...

- Finally... move the NetStatus indicator on the screen. You are no longer limited to the upper left corner.
  Using NetStatusXPos and NetStatusYPos these will be added the to default (0,0) coordinates to allow placement
  at other areas on the screen.
- Added commands /netstatusxpos, /netstatusypos to update the (x,y) screen coordinates for the NetStatus indicator.

10 May 2016
- Updated for TEST
  This will get u in game, but there are still some stuff that needs fixed, 
  the Caps needs calced for example.
  I just wont spend to much time on it now, since one or more repatches are likely.

08 May 2016

- Added .IsSwarmSpell to the Spell TLO, it return TRUE/FALSE if a spell is a swarmspell or not.
 Usage: /echo ${Spell[Chattering Bones].IsSwarmSpell}
 Output: TRUE

- Added to Spawn TLO
  EQLoc, MQLoc
- Added to Spell TLO
  Location

02 May 2016
- Maintenance release PART I: I highly recommend everyone update to this release.
- NEW STUFF:
- Added ${Me.ItemReady[xxx]} it returns a bool true or false, it was 10 years overdue, and yes i know we can check it with Item Timer but
  I like the consistency of having SpellReady, AltAbilityReady, CombatAbilityReady and now ItemReady
  it also makes it easier to remember to macro writers. -Idea cred: Maskoi
- Usage: /echo ${Me.ItemReady[=worn totem]}
- will look for an item name that exactly matches "worn totem" and return true if its ready to click/cast/use and false if not.
- Usage: /echo ${Me.ItemReady[drunkard]}
- will look for an item name that has the word "drunkard" in it and return true if its ready to click/cast/use and false if not.
- the item name is not case sensitive.

- CHANGES:
- MacroQuest2.exe should once again be winxp compatible.
- ${Me.AltAbilityTimer[xxxx]} does NOT return a pTickType anymore, its NOW a pTimeStampType, so update your macros.
- Changed the name of __bCommandEnabled_x to g_eqCommandStates_x (cause thats what it is)

- FIXES:
- Created a wrapper for ExecuteCmd cause it has 4 paramters now, and i didnt want to break plugins.
- This should fix multiple crashes as well as the "mash hotkeys too quickly crash". (yes that was likely us)
- Fixed the offset for EQ_PC__GetCombatAbilityTimer_x
- Corrected the _ZONEINFO struct(s)
- Corrected the function declaration for CSidlScreenWnd::GetChildItem note that it takes 2 arguments now.
- Corrected the function declaration for CXWnd::GetChildWndAt note that it takes 3 arguments now.
- Corrected the function declaration for CXWnd::Move (for the CXWnd__Move1_x offset).
- Corrected the function declaration for EQPlayer__DoAttack_x on EMU builds.

26 Apr 2016
- Updated for TEST
- Removed fancy progressbar message for now, it might return or not, dont know yet but im hunting a memory leak so... we'll see.

20 Apr 2016
- Updated for LIVE

15 Apr 2016
- Fixed broken spell stuff for TEST - cred demonstar55
- Added support for specifying buildtype (TEST/LIVE/BETA/EMU) in the preprocessor.
- Updated Macroquest.exe to only inject in the right eqgame.
  Example: you have macroquest loaded in the tasktray from your
  Releast(test) directory it will not try to inject into a live eqgame session.
  if you have live macroquest running and start eqgame for test it will not try
  to inject into the live client.
  This means you can have 2 macroquest.exes running and they will only inject in
  the exe that mq2main.dll is built for. (it knows what dir it was started from).

14 Apr 2016
- Updated for TEST
- Fixed ${Me.AbilityReady[Taunt]} and other abilites not on hotkeys so they work even when not "hotkeyed"

  This prevented FindItem from finding items in the illusion keyring.

30 Mar 2016
- I think I got Advloot under control now, go for it, test it as hard as u can.
- Added a new Member .LootInProgress to the AdvLoot TLO
  use it or face imminent doom!
  Usage Example:
  [code]
  /if (!${AdvLoot.LootInProgress}) {
		/echo its safe to loot
		if (${AdvLoot.SCount}>=1) {
			/echo im going to give 1 ${AdvLoot.SList[1].Name} to myself
			/advloot shared 1 giveto ${Me.Name} 1
		}
  } else {
		/echo do something else, loot is in progress...
  }
  [/code]

- Made some adjustments to doors , thanks htw

25 Mar 2016
- Fixed GetFriendlyNameForGroundItem to support instanced zones
- Misc fixes

24 Mar 2016
- Fix for ISXEQ build, it will compile again, report any weirdness on the forum.
- Fix to make /itemtarget select the closest item first
- Update to /items and /doors so they sort by Distance3D
- Updated /doortarget let me know if it fails to target
- Updated /click left door let me know if u find a door it cant open.
- Added a .DoTarget Method to the Ground TLO
  Usage: /if (${Ground[egg].DoTarget.ID}) {
               /echo we just targeted a ${Ground[egg]}
         }
- Added a .DoFace Method to the Ground TLO
  Usage: /echo (${Ground[egg].Doface.Distance3D}) {
  Will face the closest item on the ground which has the word "egg" in it.
  and then echo the distance to it in the mq2 window.
  well if it finds an item with the word "egg" in it on the ground that is, otherwise it will just echo NULL
  .DoFace does NOT target the ground item, it just faces it.

- Changed how /items <filter> work, its now case insensitive and takes any part of a word into account
  Usage: /items egg will display all items on the ground that has the word "egg" in them.
- Changed how /doors <filter> work, its now case insensitive and takes any part of a word into account
  Usage: /doors pok will display all doors in the zone which has the word "pok" in them.


23 Mar 2016
- Updated for LIVE
- WARNING! Task TLO has changed, update your macros.
- Well, I was gonna release the new Task TLO in the next zip
  but then dbg decided to patch so you guys get whatever I could finish
  before I had to release the zip.
  It needs more documantation and definately more testing as well,
  but I can say this much for now:
  /echo Task 1 is ${Task[1]}
  Output: Task 1 is Hatching a Plan
  /echo The task with "hatch" in is name is called: ${Task[hatch]} 
  Output: The task with "hatch" in is name is called: Hatching a Plan
  /echo ${Task[hatch]} is listed as number ${Task[hatch].Index} in the tasklist.
  Output: Hatching a Plan is listed as number 1 in the tasklist.
  /echo The ${Task[hatch]} first objective is to ${Task[hatch].Objective[1].Instruction}
  Output: The Hatching a Plan first objective is to find where the eggs are being incubated
  /echo The ${Task[hatch]} first objective status is ${Task[hatch].Objective[1].Status} 
  Output: The Hatching a Plan first objective status is 0/1
  /echo The ${Task[hatch]} first objective should be completed in ${Task[hatch].Objective[1].Zone}
  Output: The Hatching a Plan first objective should be completed in Hatchery Wing
  /echo I should be working on ${Task[hatch].Step} in ${Task[hatch].Step.Zone}
  Output: I should be working on find where the eggs are being incubated in Hatchery Wing
- Added .Type to the Task TLO: it outputs a string Quest or Shared depending on the task:
  Usage: /echo ${Task[hatch].Type}
  Output: Shared
- The Task TLO also has a .Select "Method" (see below for an explaination of TLO methods.)
  .Select can select list items and combobox items.
  .Select returns TRUE if a selection was made and FALSE if not.
  Usage: /if (${Task[hatch].Select}) {
			/echo I just Selected a task that has the name "hatch" in it...
		} else {
			/echo I did not find a task that has the word "hatch" in it, so nothing was selected.
		}

- Fixed a racecondition crash in mq2bzsrch.
- Fixed a plugin unload/load crash
- Made some changes to mutex locks.
- Fixed the loot and the trade struct for the test build.
- Added a new command /invoke to invoke TLO Methods...
  Basically we have had TypeMethods in the source for years, but it was never finished.
  Consider these methods beta for now.
  So from the command line or hotbuttons you can do stuff like: /invoke ${Spawn[eqmule].DoTarget}
  and it will execute the DoTarget method of the Spawn TLO... (and /target eqmule IF it finds that spawn)
  In macros it should make things more simple but at the same time add more power
  because now you can do stuff that saves a few lines, like:
  /if (${Spawn[eqmule].DoTarget.ID}) {
		/echo i just targeted ${Target}
  }
  or
  /if (${Spawn[eqmule].DoFace.ID}) {
		/echo i just faced eqmule
  }
  the following Methods are available for use and testing as of this patch:
  For the Task TLO:
	.Select
  For the Spawn[]. TLO:
	.DoTarget
	.DoFace
	.DoAssist
	.LeftClick
	.RightClick
  For the Me. TLO:
	.Stand
	.Sit
	.Dismount
	.StopCast
  For the Me.Buff TLO Member:
	.Remove
  For the Switch TLO:
	.Toggle
  For the Ground TLO:
	.Grab
  For the Window TLO:
	.LeftMouseDown
	.LeftMouseUp
	.LeftMouseHeld
	.LeftMouseHeldUp
	.RightMouseDown
	.RightMouseUp
	.RightMouseHeld
	.RightMouseHeldUp
	.Select

- And finally, there seem to be some problem with /click left door
  I will have a look at that tomorrow.

17 Mar 2016
- Fixed a crash in the ${Merchant} TLO
- Fixed a crash in the ${Task} TLO

16 Mar 2016
- Updated for LIVE
- Added a new TLO: GroundItemCount
  usage: /echo There are ${GroundItemCount[apple]} Apples on the ground
  Output: There are 5 Apples on the ground
- usage: /echo There are ${GroundItemCount} items on the ground in this zone.
  Output: There are 12 items on the ground in this zone.
- Extended the Ground TLO to accept searches
  usage: /echo The closest ${Ground[brew].DisplayName} is ${Ground[brew].Distance3D} away from you.
  output: The closest Brew Barrel is 26.4 away from you.
  Note that both of the searchfunctions are case insensitive and are sorted by distance colosest to you.
  The only acceptale parameter in the search filter is by name or partial name.

- Added .Distance3D and .DisplayName to the Ground tlo
  DisplayName will display the actual name of the ground item, .Name will still display the actorname...
  ${Ground} now defaults to ${Ground.DisplayName} instead of ${Ground.ID}
- Doortargets as well as GroundTargets are now cleared when you do a /target clear

15 Mar 2016
- Maintenance Release, bunch of cleanups and stuff that should improve overall stability.

-Updated all vcxproj files and solutions to use build.props for easier administration - Cred: brainiac

- Fixed Me.Dar, Me.Counters, Buff Dar and Buff Counters - Cred: Demonstar55
- Community can provide input if we should separate them into their elements.
- For now they return combined, which might be useless.

- FRIENDLY DEV TIP OF THE DAY:
- Some people has been asking me how to run VS as admin by default in windows 8-10:
- There is a simple trick to it, and I recommend that everyone do this, but
- especially if you are going to debug MQ2 OR build ISXEQ because it needs
- to copy files to your InnerSpace directory and that is usually located
- under Program Files (which requires admin privs).
- Anyway... to do this, paste the following link in your browser:
- http://lmgtfy.com/?q=make+visual+studio+always+run+as+administrator
- When you have followed those steps, navigate to this directory:
- C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\MSEnv
- Now locate the VSLauncher.exe in that dir, rightclick it, select properties
- Go to the compatability tab, and check the "Run this proram as an administrator" box.
- Click ok. That's it. From that point on, your VS will always start itself as admin.

12 Mar 2016
- Updated for TEST

09 Mar 2016
- Updated for TEST
- New SPA's added
- IsBodyType has been renamed to HasProperty (cause thats what it is)
- Bunch of changes to mq2windows, lets see if it works as intended.

- Added a new TLO Member to ${Me} .AssistComplete
. You can check it after you do a /assist. It will be true when the assist request has been completed.
.  Usage Example: /assist Eqmule
.                 /delay 5s ${Me.AssistComplete}==TRUE
.				  /if (${Target.ID}) {
.				      /echo EqMule wants me to help fighting ${Target}
.				  }
- Turned on Exception Handling (/EHsc) for all projects except mq2main
- when we move to the v140xp toolset we can use the noexcept keyword to turn it on for mq2main as well...

- --------------------> VERY IMPORTANT STUFF BEGIN <-------------------
- It's time to upgrade to Visual Studio 2013 Community or newer.
- From this version and onward we will not support older compilers.
- There just isn't any good reason now that Microsoft has free Community Editions
- which can build mq2 just fine.
- Therefor:
- All vcxproj files has been updated to use the vs2013 toolset (v120xp) (thanks Brainiac)
- We want to move to 2015, but we will have to wait until ISXDK supports that version.
- If you use 2015, just install the vs 2013 community edition if you want to build ISXEQ
- For mq2 it doesn't really matter, you can build it with 2015 toolset (v140 or v140xp)
- just let it upgrade if it asks for it.

- Older solution files has been removed:
- For building MQ2 use MacroQuest2.sln
- --------------------> VERY IMPORTANT STUFF END <---------------------

- If you have no interest in building ISXEQ you can stop reading now.

- For building ISXEQ use ISXEQ.sln PLEASE NOTE: --------------->
- The red headed stepchild ISXEQ has gotten some love this week.
- You might have noticed that the zip grew a bit in size this release
- the reason is that it now includes all files needed to build ISXEQ.
- So...
- This means that from now on, you can just open ISXEQ.sln and build it.
- DO NOT LET IT UPGRADE THE TOOLSET! it only works with the v120xp toolset.
- Having said that, No more additional downloads, googling for libs, headers, updating paths
- patching files, reading pages and pages of forum threads, and all that extra
- shiz that we all love to spend time on...
- In other words we made it easier to build ISXEQ "out of the box" (aka the zip)

24 Feb 2016
- Updated for TEST
- Changed how GroupAssistTarget and RaidAssistTarget works
  before this change you could get a return that was invalid when no mainassist was assigned.
  since I make sure there actually is a mainassist in the group or raid
  this is no longer possible.
- Fixed /pickzone so picks above 9 can be picked - cred: derple

19 feb 2016
- Added .BuffsPoplulated to ${Target}
-  Usage example:
-  /target pet
-  /delay 5s ${Target.ID}==${Pet.ID} && ${Target.BuffsPopulated}==TRUE
-  /echo ${Target} has ${Target.BuffCount} buffs on him.

- Trampoline following - cred: brainiac

14 feb 2016 HAPPY VALENTINES DAY!
- Removed most of the holes I punched in the source with #if defined(TEST) in the last version cred: brainiac
- Updated some stacking code cred: demonstar55
- Fixed SpellReady so it's 110% reliable now.
- minor fixes

12 feb 2016
- Fixed SpellReady so it's 100% reliable now.
- Other stuff
- Updated for TEST
- BELOW THIS LINE ARE TEST RELATED CHANGES, BUT LIVE BUILDERS SHOULD READ IT AS WELL (cause it is comming your way)

- Added CalcIndex to ${Spell} (on TEST)
- Added NumEffects to ${Spell} (on TEST)
-  Both of them SHOULD be used in macros that enumurate Base, Base2, Calc,Attrib and Max
-  Example: lets say your macro does this:
-		/for i 1 to 12
-			/echo Base ${i} is : ${Spell[Augmentation].Base[${i}]}
-		/next i
-	FROM NOW ON: IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS: (or you will get errors running it)
-		/varcalc count ${Spell[Augmentation].NumEffects} + 1
-		/for i 1 to ${count}
-			/echo Base ${i} is : ${Spell[Augmentation].Base[${i}]}
-		/next i
-							

- Ok, listen PEOPLE WHO BUILD MQ2 FOR -> TEST <- : this is IMPORTANT!:
-  This patch punched a bunch of holes in mq2, and Im telling you folks right now:
-  IF YOU DONT UPDATE YOUR PLUGINS THEY WILL Fail to build.
-  ok and here is how to update them:
-  Search EVERY single plugin you have for references to ->Base[, ->Base2[, ->Calc[, ->Attrib[ and ->Max[
-  Replace EVERY result with a proper call to the corrosponding new APIs:
-	LONG GetSpellAttrib(PSPELL pSpell, int index);
-	LONG GetSpellBase(PSPELL pSpell, int index);
-	LONG GetSpellBase2(PSPELL pSpell, int index);
-	LONG GetSpellMax(PSPELL pSpell, int index);
-	LONG GetSpellCalc(PSPELL pSpell, int index);
-	Let me give and example: You do the search and you find this code:
-	for (int a = 0; a < 12; a++) {
-		switch (spell->Attrib[a])
-	YOU MUST replace that code... with this:
-	if (PSPELL spell = GetSpellByID(SpellID)) {
-		for (int a = 0; a < GetSpellNumEffects(spell); a++) {
-			switch (GetSpellAttrib(spell, a))

-	Notice what I did there? you CANNOT and SHOULD NOT use hardcoded "12" anymore
-	It just isn't how spell effects are stored anymore, they only store
-	the ACTUAL number of effects in memory, not all 12 slots...
-	So... the new Spell member function GetSpellNumEffects(x) SHOULD ALWAYS be used from now on.

-	Mkay? questions?, come talk to us on irc/skype/email whatever...
-	And finally, for the LIVE people... this is comming your way within a week or so when
-	they patch for LIVE, so get ready, cause I'm not going to repeat this info again.
-  This message will self destruct in 3...2...1...

02 Dec 2015 by Devs
- Well... This is probably the most important update to MQ2 in years.
  Recent changes to the client released with the new Broken Mirror expansion
  added a new type of MQ2 detection which is meant to prevent mq2 usage on the new Phinigel server.
  We fully support the NO MQ2 policy on Phinigel, and we want to continue
  supporting that policy and backup DBG any way we can that’s within reason.
  We have therefor decided to add a new type of integrity checker to MQ2.
  We have placed the code in a MQ2 plugin that has been named MQ2Ic.dll. (MQ2 Integrity checker)
  We feel strongly that MQ2 is in a symbiosis with Everquest, and it’s important to us
  that all MQ2 users feel safe while they use MQ2.
  MQ2 users are an important part of the Everquest community and we wish to keep it that way.
  In short, we recommend you keep MQ2Ic.dll loaded while you are playing Everquest.
  It will protect your integrity on all servers EXCEPT Phinigel.
  It will be included in every zip from now on, and will be maintained by active mq2 devs.
  Its usage is optional though, and you can unload and load it like any other plugin, but it comes loaded by default.
  This plugin will also fix some recent plugin issues and crashes as well as improve the fps performance.
  All questions about this plugin should be directed to eqmule@hotmail.com

  Outputs: [MQ2] Polymorph Wand: Steam Suit
  Usage: /echo ${Illusion[Polymorph Wand: Steam Suit].Index}
  Outputs: [MQ2] 2
- New Feature: you can now use /useitem on illusion items even if they are in the keyring
  usage: /useitem Polymorph Wand: Steam Suit
- Change: there used to be a value in the itemstruct called CastTime
  I noticed it was actully FoodDuration, so it has been renamed.
  If you have any plugins that used "someitem->CastTime" from that struct,
  you need to change that to whatever you intend it to do, cause for whatever
  reason you have been using it up til this point, you have gotten FoodDuration back...
  Im guessing that was a bug, and you really wanted someitem->Clicky.CastTime instead...
  so adjust accordingly.

- Please don't use MQ2 for unattended gameplay (afk botting)
- BIG NEWS!
- After a really long time, messing with this on and off
  I'm proud to present support for splash spells in the cast command.
  You can now cast any splash spell as long as you have a target.
  If you dont have a target it will just cast it at your own location.
  There is no need for window in focus, or full screen or any of that stuff
  you dont even have to be facing the target.
  Basically the only requirement is that its in lineofsight and in range.
  The splash feature was brought to you as a joined effort
  with Demonstar55 as the main contributor, his tireless dissasembling
  and reverse engineering as well as updates on the progress on skype, irc etc
  was a major help in bringing this to you all, so give him a shoutout!
  I need to mention ctaylor22 as well for pushing me to work on it at all.
  Anyway... enjoy.
- Added a new member to the Spawn TLO: CanSplashLand, it returns true or false
  usage: /echo ${Target.CanSplashLand}
  I suggest you use this tlo member in your macros BEFORE you try to cast a splashspell
  there is no point in casting it if it wont land due to a line of sight problem.
  NOTE! This check is ONLY for line of sight to the targetindicator (red/green circle)
  its NOT a range check, you need to check range yourself like for every other spell
  before you cast it...

21 Oct 2015 by EqMule
- Please don't use MQ2 for unattended gameplay (afk botting)
- Updated for LIVE
- Fixed and cleaned a bunch of small stuff but it is possible I broke some stuff as well,
 report if u find something that worked in last zip and not in this one.
- ${DisplayItem} now takes an index as an option parameter index can be 0-5
  you can still just do ${DsiplayItem} and it will just pick whatever you inspected last.
  Example: /echo ${DisplayItem[5]}
- Added a few new members to the DisplayItem TLO:
		Info = 1,
		WindowTitle = 2,
		AdvancedLore = 3,
		MadeBy = 4,
		Information = 5,
		DisplayIndex = 6
  There is a difference between .Info and .Information .Info contains for example:
  .Info can return text like; this item is placable in yards, guild yards blah blah , This item can be used in tradeskills
  .Information can return text like Item Information: Placing this augment into blah blah, this armor can only be used in blah blah

17 Oct 2015 by EqMule

- Updated for TEST
- Fixed a few VS 2015 compile warnings.

07 Oct 2015 by EqMule
- Please don't use MQ2 for unattended gameplay (afk botting)
- Added some stuff to the ALTABILITY struct, cred demonstar55
- Renamed AARankRequired to CurrentRank in the ALTABILITY struct
- Added .PointsSpent to the altbility TLO it returns points you spent on an AA
- Added .Rank to the altbility TLO it returns current rank of an AA
- Reminder: .MaxRank in the altbility TLO it returns max rank of an AA
- I'm sorry (not really) but in my ongoing efforts to clean up the API
  I had to rename a couple functions, so take notice and go over your plugins:
  mq2cast and mq2melee calls these for example. See below:
- Renamed GetAltAbility to GetAAById (cause thats what it is)
- Renamed GetAltAbilityIndex to GetAlternateAbilityId (cause thats what it is)

01 Oct 2015 by EqMule
- Please don't use MQ2 for unattended gameplay (afk botting)
- Fixed a bunch of POSIX stuff
- Made sure Target.Buff and Target.BuffDuration now works on spells without having to specify Rank
  example: /echo ${Target.BuffDuration[Pyromancy]} would FAIL prior to todays patch
  now it wont.
  example 2: /echo ${Target.Buff[Pyromancy]} would return NULL prior to todays patch
  now it returns the correct name including its rank: so Pyromancy XV for example...

30 Sep 2015 by EqMule (ALERTS AND MORE ALERTS AND STUFF)
- THIS IS A MACROBREAKING PATCH! (so read these notes)
- Please don't use MQ2 for unattended gameplay (afk botting)
- Fixed .Mercenary in the spawnstruct for TEST -cred demonstar55
- GetGuildIDByName now returns 0xFFFFFFFF and not 0x0000FFFF if a guild is NOT found, so if you use this function in a plugin adjust acordingly.
- Fixed a problem with searching through spawns for guild members
  This might break you macros so pay attention!:
  Prior to THIS patch there was a difference in CASE with guild/GUILD in spawn searches:
  IF you wanted to search for a spawn like this:
  /echo ${Spawn[radius 75 pc guild noalert 6]}
  THAT WOULD MAKE MQ2 THINK the guild you where looking for was called "noalert" 
  now if that was not your intention, you should have used UPPERCASE GUILD instead
  and it would just search for people in YOUR guild.
  In order to not use this confusing method of searching through spawns
  I have decided to rename lowercase guild to guildname
  so from this point and onward, you CAN specify guild OR GUILD and it will just pick your own guild
  in order to search for players of a specific guild use "guildname" and note that if there are spaces in the guildname you need encase with "".
  Example: ${Spawn[radius 75 pc guildname "Some Cool Guild" noalert 6]}
- Added a new TLO: ${Alert}
  it has 2 members: List which returns a AlertListType and Size which returns a IntType
  Usage Example 1: /alert add 1 ${Me.Name}
		 /echo ${Alert[1].List[0].Name}
		 Outputs: eqmule
		 /echo ${Alert[1].List[0].Spawn.Race}
		 Outputs: Dark Elf (or whatever my Class is)
  Usage Example 2: /alert add 1 id ${Me.ID}
         /echo ${Alert[1].List[0].SpawnID}
		 Output: 12345 (or whatever my spawnid is)
         /echo ${Alert[1].Size}
		 Output: 2 (or whatever size your alert list for 1 is)
  Usage Example 3: /alert remove 1 id ${Me.ID}
         removes the list entry from alert 1 that matches: id ${Me.ID}
- Added a new TLO Type: MQ2AlertListType which has the following members:
  well it has a crapload of members look at the source to list them but basically
  it has all the members SEARCHSPAWN has plus one extra that I call Spawn
  Spawn inherits the spawntype see the example above...
  Note that: .Spawn will only work if your alert has either .Name or .SpawnID set.
- Bunch of other stuff fixed/added/fightclub/updated/rewritten etc.
- ${Spell[some spell]} now looks through your aa list as well if it cant find a spell
  I did that to take the new ranks into account for example prior to this patch
  /echo ${Spell[Boastful Bellow].Range} would fail because the Boastful Bellow spell
  has been renamed to Boastful Bellow I
  anyway the fix is now in and it also means .RankName will return ranks for these kinds
  of alt abilities.

25 Sep 2015 by EqMule
- Please don't use MQ2 for unattended gameplay (afk botting)
- Updated for TEST again... (cmon man are u trying to kill me?!!, scowls at hludwolf ready to attack ;)
- So... when they patch at 8.30pm I have 2 choices:
  1. wait until the morning and go over it manually.
  2. run a quickpatch, cross fingers and release without proper testing.
  Well, I did 2. and went to bed, I guess it didnt work as intended
  uhm, so the structs has been corrected, castready and so on
  should be working again...

  toon.
  Eg., add ALL=<command> under [Autorun]
- Modified ground spawn detection to allow the value based on the actual zone.

  if you have plugins that refer to these make sure u rename as well.
- the size of the _AGGROINFO struct changed. Cred: demonstar55
- Added .Icon to the MQ2ItemType TLO
- Added Scroll to the mouseinfo struct. Thanks Brainiac,
- Fixed a crash in /windowstate that could happen when using a (bad) Custom UI. Thanks demonstar55
- since GetCombatAbilityTimer now accepts -1 as a timer, I have removed that check
  this means you should remove it from mq2melee as well for example:
  this line: if (EFFECT->ReuseTimerIndex && TYPE != AA && EFFECT->ReuseTimerIndex != -1)
  becomes this: if (EFFECT->ReuseTimerIndex!=0 && TYPE != AA)

- This is a heads up:
  In the near future I will restrict /target to a radius of 360
  I do this because its unreasonable to target stuff across zones.
  There is absolutely no scenario where you have a reason to target a mob
  until its within that range. So change your macros now if they do this.
  If you have line of sight to a mob there will be no radius restriction.

  example: /echo My gloves has ${Me.Inventory[Hands].Augs} augslots.
  NOTE: I dont know how this worked in the past, but this only counts how
  many augslots an item has, it doesnt check if there is actually an augment

- Fixed a 10 year old bug where GetSpellDuration would use pCharSpawn (which can be a level 30 mount)
  instad of the correct pLocalPlayer (which is actually your characters spawn with correct level)
  the impact of this would be that spells that scale their duration by the level of the caster
  would return a shorter duartion when on a mount...
  example: doing /echo ${Spell[Enticer's Command].Duration.Minutes} on a level 105 enc would return 4 when on a mount and 7 when not

- Please don't use MQ2 for unattended gameplay (afk botting)
- Fixed a problem with combat abilities (thanks to William12 for the report)
  Before this change you could buy a rank 1 combatability, lets say Rest
  Then you bought Rest Rk. II
  At that point BOTH are saved in your combatabilities array...
  (I think thats a eq bug cause it sure isn't needed)
  Anyway... doing something like ${Spell[Rest].RankName}
  would then fail cause it would find "Rest" first...
  The fix is basically calling pCombatSkillsSelectWnd->ShouldDisplayThisSkill
   in every place NUM_COMBAT_ABILITIES is used...

  an item that is not a clicky item and causes a CTD).

07 May 2015 by EqMule & demonstar55
- AltTimer in the _SKILL struct has been renamed to (the correct name) SkillCombatType (whatever that is...)
- Added .Stuck to the SpawnType TLO, i never seen it return TRUE, so more testing is needed...
- Added .PlayerState to the SpawnType TLO, it returns a mask as an inttype which has the following meaning:
  0=Idle 1=Open 2=WeaponSheathed 4=Aggressive 8=ForcedAggressive 0x10=InstrumentEquipped 0x20=Stunned
  0x40=PrimaryWeaponEquipped 0x80=SecondaryWeaponEquipped
  This too needs more testing.
- Added .Stunned to the spawntype TLO it returns TRUE or FALSE if a mob is stunned or not
  NOTE: .Stunned DID exist in the spawntype TLO before, but it only returned your character's Stunstate
  THIS MEANS IF YOU RELY ON THIS IN YOUR MACROS, use ${Me.Stunned} in your macros from now on instead
  when you need YOUR stunstate and the below examples when you need a SPAWNS stunstate, you have been warned...
  Usage: /echo ${Target.Stunned} or ${Spawn[npc somespawnname].Stunned}
- Added .Aggressive to the spawntype TLO it returns TRUE or FALSE if a mob is aggressive or not
- Cred .PlayerState and .Stuck: demonstar55
- Couple additions to /advloot
- /advloot shared # now accepts leave and giveto as arguments
  Usage:
  /advloot shared <#(index) or "item name"> giveto <name> <opt:qty> (qty is optional, if you leave it out it will give full stack)
  /advloot shared <#(index) or "item name"> leave
  Examples:
  Lets say there is a stack of 4 spiderling silks in the first list item of the shared lootwindow
  /advloot shared 1 giveto eqmule 1
  /advloot shared 1 giveto SwiftyMUSE
  Will give 1 spiderling silks to eqmule
  Will give the remaining 3 spiderling silk to SwiftyMUSE (we didnt specify qty, so it just gave the rest)
  /advloot shared "spiderling silk" leave
  Will just leave the first "spiderling silk" it finds in the shared list on the corpse...
  or /advloot shared 1 leave
  Will just leave whatever is in list index 1 in the shared list on the corpse... (in our example spiderling silk)

05 May 2015 by SwiftyMUSE

  Usage Example: see this post: http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=19699&p=169467#p169467
- Fixed a crash that would happen if you logged all the way into the game
  then all the way out to server select, and back in again
  and at that point tried to call GetSpellByName or any
  of the TLO's that calls it.
- Added a few more members to the AdvLoot TLO: all return TRUE or FALSE if checkbox is checked
  .AutoRoll .Need .Greed .No .AlwaysNeed .AlwaysGreed .Never
  Usage Example: /if (${AdvLoot.SList[1].Need}==TRUE) item 1 in the shared list has Need checked. 
- Added PWantCount and SWantCount which counts the number of items in each list that has a checkmark
  in any of the need and greed boxes.
  Usage Example: /echo /if (${AdvLoot.SCount} && ${AdvLoot.SWantCount}) /advloot shared set ${Me.Name}

  Usage: /notify ${Window[SomeWindow].FirstChild.FirstChild.Next.Address} leftmouseup
  Usage: /notify ${Window[SomeWindow].Next.Child[Alist].Address} listselect 2

15 Apr 2015 by eqmule
- Added a new TLO for AdvLoot, this is a first draft, test it, report bugs, and so on to me.
  I need a volunteer to update the wiki with this new TLO and its usage/members
  It has a few members SList,PList,SCount and PCount
  /echo ${AdvLoot.PList[1].Name}
  Output: [MQ2] Bone Chips
  /echo there are ${AdvLoot.PCount} items in the personal loot list
  Output: [MQ2] there are 3 items in the personal lootlist
  /echo the item in index 1 has a StackSize of ${AdvLoot.PList[1].StackSize}
  Output: [MQ2] the item in index 1 has a StackSize of 2
  Alright at this point we know the item in index one is a stack of 2 bone chips
  Now we can decide to do something about it:
  /advloot personal/shared 1 leave
  That will click the leave button...
  /advloot personal/shared 1 ag
  That will click the ag checkbox
  And so on...
  Finally you can do
  /advloot shared set Eqmule 
  Or whatever other group member or Never or Leave on corpse or

04 Mar 2015 by eqmule & SwiftyMUSE
- made a few changes to how GetSpellByName works
  from now on I placed all of the spelldb in a map.
  the main reason for this is so we can pick spells that best matches our class
  and if it doesnt , at least pick a spell that is class usable.
  if both of those selections fails, we will just revert to old pick, which is to select whichever spell comes first
  in the db...
  Using this map has made spell lookup between 20-200 times faster than before.
  If you are interested in testing this, add a QueryPerformanceCounter before and after
  the call and you will see this for yourself.
- this also fixes problems with getting correct spells for .RankName
- Misc Fixes & Code cleanup
- ${Zone[xxxxx] if xxxxx is larger than MAX_ZONES no longer crashes the client.
- .RankName now returns the input spell if there is no rank found or if the character you do the query on doesnt have the spell.

- Added new TLO Alias - Code by Cr4zyb4rd
  see this post for more info: http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=19240&p=167005&hilit=alias#p167005
- Added IsActiveAA to the Spell TLO
  Usage: /echo ${Spell[Origin].IsActiveAA}
  returns: TRUE since Origin is a "Active" AltAbility as opposite to a Passive ability.
- Fixed the EQMisc__GetActiveFavorCost_x offset how long has it been broken?
- Added some stuff to make ISXEQ compile

02 Feb 2015 by eqmule
 - Added .Expansion to the Me.AltAbillity TLO it returns a inttype
 - Added .Flags to the Me.AltAbillity TLO it returns a inttype
 - Added .Passive to the Me.AltAbillity TLO it returns a booltype TRUE if its a passive ability and false if its an active.
 - Added a check for plugin unloading to not try to unload plugins that has already been unloaded...
   not exactly sure if it will help, but im trying to mitigate a crash i have seen when doing /unload
   time will tell.
- Added pcpet and npcpet to searchspawn
  This means you can do stuff like /who pcpet and see a list of all pets that belong to players
  OR /who npcpet and you only see a list of pets that belong to NPCs
  OR /echo ${SpawnCount[npcpet]} to get a count of all npc pets in a zone...
  just specifying pet works as it always have and returns all pets... npc and pc owned...
  Idea: Nytemyst
- Added /mercswitch functionality it will now accept Healer, Damage Caster, Melee Damage and Tank as arguments
  usage: /mercswitch Damage Caster
  and it will switch your merc to the Damage Caster (if you have one and its not already active
  which brings us to:
- Added Mercenary.Index which returns your mercenary's Current list index
- Added Me.MercListInfo which is used in the following ways:
  usage1: /echo ${Me.MercListInfo[1]} returns whatever mercenary type is in Index 1 (there are max 7) as a string and it can be : Healer, Damage Caster, Melee Damage or Tank
  usage2: /echo ${Me.MercListInfo[Healer]} returns the index to the first Healer it finds... as a IntType or 0 if not found.
  This is new code, so there might be some changes to it in the future depending on feedback.

  usage: /if (${something}) /echo blah blah something happened on Line ${Macro.CurLine}
- Updated Instructions: .Equipment[x].ID doesnt exist, see example below:
  .Equipment in the Spawn TLO returns a inttype, it takes numbers 0-8 or names: head chest arms wrists hands legs feet primary offhand
  Usage: /if (${Pet.Equipment[primary]}==12507) /echo my pet is holding a Frightforged Ragesword in his primary hand
  Usage: /if (${Group.Member[mymagesname].Pet.Equipment[primary]}==12507) /echo my mages pet is holding a Frightforged Ragesword in his primary hand

15 Jan 2015 by SwiftyMUSE
- added /break and /continue for /for loops.

14 Jan 2015 by eqmule
- Updated for test patch
- This is a pretty extensive patch, please do a FULL Rebuild.
- New Feature see: http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=19610
  you can now have your pet attack a mob without having to target the mob first.
  Usage: /pet attack/qattack # where # is the spawnid of the mob u want the pet to attack
  Example: /pet attack ${Spawn[npc targetable los radius 200 range 1 20].ID}
- Changed the way crashreports are handled.
  You will get an option to break into debugger now.
  I also added some info to the crash detected messagebox
  that lets you know where you can find a copy of the crashdump.
  Not every crash is related to mq2, but if you have a call stack
  where you see mq2main.dll, mail the .dmp to me.
- Added .InInstance to the character TLO
  it returns true if you are in an instance.
  Credit: PeteSampras
- Added a line of code to prevent a ctd in chatwindow
- Added .Offline to the Group.Member TLO
  Usage: /echo ${Group.Member[x].Offline}

- Added .OtherZone to the Group.Member TLO
  Usage: /echo ${Group.Member[x].OtherZone}
  will return a Bool TRUE if online but in another zone and FALSE if online and in same zone as you.
- Added .AnyoneMissing to the Group TLO
  Usage: /echo ${Group.AnyoneMissing}
  returns TRUE if someone is missing in group, offline, in other zone or simply just dead...
- Rewrote /Alerts again, I wasn't happy with the last version
  lets see if this one is better.

31 Dec 2014 Happy New Year Edition by eqmule
- New Feature see: http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=19608
  if you have an item on your cursor and click the name on the targetwindow
  a trade will be initiated and the tradewindow will open.
  Good for tradeing stuff quickly in crowded places like raids or guildhall
- Added a new argument to the /Alerts command [remove]
  it just removes an alert from a list
  Example: /Alert remove 1 npc los
  will remove a previously added alert from list 1 that has is alert on npc and los
  Also alerts are now in a std::list, let me know if there are any problems with this.
  I really hope this wont break any macros, cause code seems to execute a bit faster...

31 Dec 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Updated spell stacking (stacks, stackspet, stackswith, willstack)
  Allow stacking of spells that have a greater effect over a lesser one. Used with damage absorption, spell haste, aggro multiplier.
  The change should not break anything existing as I have just put the triggered effects override in the stackswith/willstack code.
  Only updated the stackswith code, willstack is using the old code for comparison purposes. Once we determine the fix doesn't break
  anything, the willstack code will be converted to the new code.
- Added .Hour12 to Time TLO
  returns a string of the format ## AM/PM.
- Change: included "told you," in chat events.

29 Dec 2014 by eqmule
- Botauthors, you can stop summoning pet weapons when its not needed:
- Added .Primary and .Secondary to the Spawn TLO
  both return a inttype which is the idfile id for whatever the spawn is holding in his primary or secondary slot.
- Added .Equipment to the Spawn TLO
  it returns a inttype, it takes numbers 0-8 or names: head chest arms wrists hands legs feet primary offhand
  Usage: /if (${Pet.Equipment[primary]}==12507) /echo my pet is holding a Frightforged Ragesword in his primary hand
  Usage: /if (${Group.Member[mymagesname].Pet.Equipment[primary]}==12507) /echo my mages pet is holding a Frightforged Ragesword in his primary hand
- Change: spawn tlo member .Holding is now a booltype.
  it will return 0 of spawn is not holding anything and 1 if it is.
- BugFix: InitializeMQ2Commands is now called before InitializeMQ2Pulse so we wont end up with a race condition in HideDoCommand...
  the only reason this has worked mostly? fine the last 10 years or whenever it was added in this order
  is cause computers where slower back in the day...
  Anyway if the gCommandCS Critical Section is not initialized when used in HideDoCommand ( CAutoLock DoCommandLock(&gCommandCS);)
  we will hang... (Also changed EnterCriticalSection to a TryEnterCriticalSection, cause there is no reason to get stuck if its the same thread calling it, or is there?
  I'm prepared to revisit this topic if any weird problems arises, let me know...)
- Fix/New Feature: /notify QuantityWnd QTYW_slider newvalue # works now/again (did it ever?) Thanks to nytemyst for the report.
- /windows open now only returns actual open and visible windows.
  I dont know if we need to make an adjustment to this, lets see what people who use that command think.

27 Dec 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Fix for /sellitem, the offset was wrong.

24 Dec 2014 Christmas Edition by Santa
- I finally managed to bring perfect LineOfSight to MQ2
  This means no more false positives... Ever...
  Now, poeple ask me, why did it take you 10 years to fix this when it was
  such a simple fix? Well, I actually had to write 1000 lines of code to know which 999 to throw away...
  Anyway Enjoy it, Please see:
  http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=19601

  -Usage ${Target.LineOfSight} or ${LineOfSight[${Me.Y},${Me.X},${Me.Z}:${Target.Y},${Target.X},${Target.Z}]}
   Example: /echo there are ${SpawnCount[npc los radius 200 range 100 110]} mobs within a radius of 200 that i can see between level 100 and 110
   Ouptut there are 3 mobs within a radius of 200 that i can see between level 100 and 110

- Splitted ${Target.Maloed} and ${Target.Tashed}
  Maloed only returns a spelltype if the mob actually has a resist debuff casted by a mage or a shaman
  and Tashed only returns a spelltype if the mob actually has a resist debuff casted by a enchanter.

11 Dec 2014 by eqmule
- Updated for patch
- /useitem now works for mounts in the mount key ring.
  Please see change message from the 09 Dec 2014
  for more info on this.

09 Dec 2014 by eqmule
- Added Feature:
  /useitem now works for mounts in the mount key ring.
  /useitem now accepts both quoted and unquoted arguments.
  /useitem now accepts partial arguments.
  Example: /useitem 1 0 or /useitem "Abyssal Steed" or /useitem Abyssal Steed or /useitem Abyssal
  NOTE: if you enclose the argument with quotes, it WILL expect that whats inside the quotes is
  an exact name, so /useitem "Abyssal" wont work, but /useitem Abyssal will...
  also, its not case sensitive, so /useitem abyssal will work as well.
- Added Feature:
  ${FindItem[blah blah]} now finds mounts that are in the mount keyring as well.
- Added MQ2MountType TLO for now it only have 2 members, Index and Name
  Usage: /echo ${Mount[1].Name}
  Outputs: [MQ2] Whirligig Flyer Control Device
  Usage: /echo ${Mount[2].Name}
  Outputs: [MQ2] Abyssal Steed
  Usage: /echo ${Mount[Abyssal Steed].Index}
  Outputs: [MQ2] 2

22 Nov 2014 by eqmule
- Added a fix (to a eqbug) which affects Target.Beneficial.
  the player buffs "leak" and shows up briefly in the target buff window
  you can see this if you make target buff window large enough.
  Of course the best fix would be if the eqdevs just made sure player buffs
  dont show up in the targetbuff window, but I dont know if they
  see this a bug or a feature, or even if they are aware.

19 Nov 2014 by eqmule

12 September 2014 by eqmule
- WARNING!!! MACRO BREAKING CHANGES!
- I have continued my effort to get a higher resolution on timers in MQ2...
  I just can't do them all at once cause it will
  wreak to much havoc in your macros...
- I have updated the following TLOs:
  MQ2TargetBuffType and MQ2BuffType
  The BuffDuration and Duration members.
  They NO longer return a pTicksType.
  Both return a pTimeStampType now.
  This means you can get a higher resolution since default return is milliseconds.
  BUT IT ALSO MEANS ALL MACROS THAT EXPECT TICKS WILL BREAK...
  So go through all you macros and search for ".Duration"
  and ".BuffDuration" and make sure they are working.
  Usage examples:
  /echo ${Target.Hasted.Duration.TotalSeconds}
  returns: 3668
  /echo ${Target.BuffDuration[Hastening of Sviir Rk. II].TotalSeconds}
  returns: 3537
  /echo ${Me.Buff[Hastening of Sviir Rk. II].Duration.TotalSeconds}
  returns: 3432

- Added Maloed and Tashed to the Target TLO
  they both return a pTargetBuffType TLO which has 3 members:
  Address (pIntType), Index (pIntType) and Duration (pTicksType).
  It also inherits pSpellType.
  This means that you can to stuff like:
  /if (${Bool[${Target.Tashed]}==TRUE) /echo ${Target.Tashed.Name} will fade in ${Target.Tashed.Duration.TotalSeconds}s
  [MQ2] Tashania will fade in 114s

- Added FirstFreeSlot to the Item TLO, it returns an Int.
  Usage:
  /echo ${FindItem[Spell Research Kit].FirstFreeSlot}
  [MQ2] 5
- Added SlotsUsedByItem to the Item TLO, it returns an Int.
  NOTE: it only works for containers and checks only each slot of the container
  this means you CAN have a stack of 100 water flask in slot 1 of the container
  it will still just return 1 cause it counts only how many slots that has "Water Flask"
  in them not the actual stacksize of the item.
  Usage:
  /echo My Spell Research Kit has ${FindItem[Spell Research Kit].SlotsUsedByItem[Water Flask]}} slots that has Water Flask(s) in them.
  [MQ2] My Spell Research Kit has 4 slots that has Water Flask(s) in them.

19 July 2014 by eqmule
- Fix for missing offset

18 July 2014 by eqmule
- Updated for friday night ninja patch...
- Added 2H Piercing to skill definitions.

16 July 2014 by eqmule
- Updated for patch
- NUM_SPELL_SETS is now 30
- /useitem now searches for items by exact name.
  Example: /useitem "Philter of the Wolf V"
  will uee that potion
  /useitem "Philter of the Wolf VI"
  will use that one...
  prior to this patch doing a /useitem "Philter of the Wolf VI"
  would use "Philter of the Wolf V" if it found that one first...

30 June 2014 by eqmule
- Added new command: /removebuff
  it will remove a buff or a song by name or partial name.
  Usage: /removebuff Summon Drogmor
- Added new command: /makemevisible
  it will make you visible.
  Usage: /makemevisible

26 June 2014 by eqmule
- Fixed MercAAExp,MercAAPoints and MercAAPointsSpent
  this means /echo ${Mercenary.AAPoints} works again.
- Added Leader to the Task TLO it returns a pStringType
  Usage: /echo The task leader is ${Task.Leader}
  Outputs: The task leader is eqmule

23 Jun 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Corrected several CTD bugs when a character did not have anything in
  their bank and/or shared bank.

21 Jun 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Fixed a bug with pMacroQuestType where pEverQuestType members wouldn't
  inherit correctly. All old ${MacroQuest.} members should work correctly
  now again.

20 Jun 2014 by eqmule
- Updated for patch
- Fixed a problem with writing plugins to MacroQuest.ini when ReadOnly.
  Bug Reported by: Xath
  See: http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=19458

19 Jun 2014 by eqmule
- Added back Windows XP Support for GetTickCount64()
  Plugins should change all calls from GetTickCount64()
  to GetTickCount642() which detects if its on winxp
  and calls the old function instead of the new one.
  As a sidenote, if you are still using winxp, know that right this
  moment you have already been pwned and with 100% certainty you are part
  of someones botnet. If you are lucky they wont steal you eqlogin
  just use your computer to click ads or something...
- Fixed a bug with .RankName where two different spells
  can belong to same spellgroup.
  The solution was to compare by SpellGroup AND the spellname.
  Bug Reported by: MacQ
  See http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=19455

18 Jun 2014 by eqmule
- Updated for patch.
- The Spell TLO member .RankName now works for combatabilities as well
  Example: /echo My version of Rest is: ${Spell[Rest].RankName}
  Outputs: [MQ2] My version of Rest is: Rest Rk. II

17 Jun 2014 by eqmule
- ${Me.PID} ha been moved to the EverQuest TLO
  so it is now ${EverQuest.PID}
- ${Me.WinTitle} has been moved to the EverQuest TLO
  so it is now ${EverQuest.WinTitle}
- New TLO: EverQuest - Cred: Cybertech
  it has basically the same members as the old MacroQuest TLO
  but I think most of them are more fitting under the EverQuest TLO.
  MacroQuest TLO will inherit EverQuest TLO so backward compatibility is maintained
  BUT new macros should use EverQuest instead.
- Added SpellGroup and SubSpellGroup to the Spell TLO
- Added RankName to the Spell TLO - Cred: petesampras,htw,maskoi
  it returns a pSpellType rather than a pStringType, but since default is the .Name
  and I think thats how most people will use it, its called "RankName"
  Usage: /echo I have the ${Spell[Certitude].RankName} version of Certitude its ID is: ${Spell[Certitude].RankName.ID}
  Output:
  [MQ2] I have the Certitude Rk. II version of Ceritude its ID is:
  Second example: Lets say you have Vinespur Rk. II in your spellbook (and memmed)
  then doing a /cast "${Spell[Vinespur].RankName}" in your macro will cast it, since its
  going to be resolved as /cast "Vinespur Rk. II"
  This should decrease the edititing of inifiles everytime you buy a new rank of a spell.

Friday the 13th!! (of June 2014 by eqmule)
- Added Rank to the Spell TLO, it returns a pIntType thats either 1, 2 or 3 for spells
  and 4-30 for clickys and potions. - Cred: petesampras
  This represents the spell rank, i.e a Rk. II Spell will return a 2.
  Usage: /echo ${Spell[Certitude Rk. II].Rank}
  Outputs: [MQ2] 2
- Added 3 new members to the Character TLO: (a while ago, just forgot to mention it.)
    ZoneBoundX, ZoneBoundY, ZoneBoundZ
	they return a pFloatType
- ${Me.Name}, ${Me.Surname} ${Me.Level} ${Me.ID} now works at charselect as well.
  There is no good reason to duplicate them, so from now on they are fetched from
  LocalPlayer instead since that one exist at charselect, but pCharInfo does not.
- Removed the follow since they are no longer in the client:
	TypeMember(GroupLeaderExp);
	TypeMember(RaidLeaderExp);
	TypeMember(GroupLeaderPoints);
	TypeMember(RaidLeaderPoints);
	TypeMember(PctGroupLeaderExp);
	TypeMember(PctRaidLeaderExp);

10 Jun 2014 by eqmule
- Since someone asked me this:
  -Q: Can you make the /setwintitle set it each time u zone?
  -A: Yes, create a file called zoned.cfg into your Release\Configs Folder
  and paste for example: /SetWinTitle EverQuest - ${Me.Name} (${Zone.ShortName})
  into it.
- Fixed a problem with Auras being detected as a Named spawn. Cred Maskoi.
- Fixed a bug in SearchSpawn where it would return Untargetable mobs
  even though the untargetable flag wasnt set.
  This means ${Spawn[npc radius 100]} wont return Arcane Distillect anymore,
  but ${Spawn[npc untargetable radius 100]} will. (if one is in radius)
- IsInGroup and IsInRaid now checks for Player's corpse as well as Player
  (as long as you specify [pccorpse] in the spawnsearch.)
  This means you can now do stuff like:
  /echo ${SpawnCount[pccorpse Group zradius 50 radius 110]}
  /echo ${SpawnCount[pccorpse Raid zradius 50 radius 110]}

09 Jun 2014 by eqmule
- Fixed? /while
  Feel free to test it and report any bugs.
- Added /GetWinTitle and /SetWinTitle Commands
- Added WinTitle to the Character TLO: it returns a pStringType
- Added PID (Process ID) to the Character TLO: it returns a pIntType
  Usage:
  /SetWinTitle [${EverQuest.PID}] EverQuest - ${Me.Name} (Lvl:${Me.Level} ${Me.Class})
  /echo ${EverQuest.WinTitle}
  [MQ2] [2319] EverQuest - Eqmule (Lvl:100 Shadow Knight)

01 Jun 2014 by eqmule
- Added three new MQ2Type(s): MQ2TimeStampType, MQ2Int64Type and MQ2DoubleType
  MQ2TimeStampType has the same submembers as pTicksType
  with the difference being that the default return value is milliseconds.

- MACRO-BREAKING CHANGE! (if your macro uses Me.GemTimer)
  Look, for years we relied on updating stuff every 6 seconds (1 tick)...
  I had to make this change since the client updates more often nowadays.
  Which is why:
  ${Me.GemTimer[x]} now returns a pTimeStamp.
  The default return is milliseconds until gem is refreshed.
  Usage Example: /echo ${Me.GemTimer[5].TotalSeconds}
  Outputs: [MQ2] 25

- All references to GetTickCount() have been replaced with GetTickCount64()
  This will fix problems related to all timers for people who dont do a complete
  shutdown of their computer earlier or on every 49.7th day.
  Plugin authors should replace all references to GetTickCount() in their plugins
  with GetTickCount64() as well.
- ${Macro.Runtime} now returns a pInt64Type to be able to hold the return of GetTickCount64
  if you are using ${Macro.Runtime} in your macro, make sure it works as intended. 

23 May 2014 by eqmule
- Fixed a fix...
  Sorry but I was in the middle of testing stuff yesterday and today they patched so
  in order to get everything out quick for x2 weekend
  I missed a bug in GetSpellByID, its fixed now (again)

23 May 2014 by eqmule
- Updated for patch

22 May 2014 by eqmule
- Secured a few functions that calls GetSpellByID against buffer overflows.

21 May 2014 by eqmule
- Updated for patch

15 May 2014 by eqmule
- Updated for patch

14 May 2014 by eqmule
- Updated for patch

12 May 2014 by eqmule
- Added nogroup to searchspawn - cred htw
  This means you can do stuff like /echo ${Bool[${NearestSpawn[1, nogroup pc radius 300]}]}
  it will return TRUE if there is at least 1 player within 300 radius of you thats NOT in your group.
- Added case Range: to ItemType

08 May 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Update of SpellSlotInfo for SPA's 157 to format as a ranged value
- Added MaxBuffSlots, changed FreeBuffSlots to use the new function that gets the max buff slots

29 Apr 2014 by eqmule
- Updated for patch

26 Apr 2014 by eqmule
- If using an old ItemDB.txt you will now see a message asking you to update it.

24 Apr 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Fix for reuse timer in spell slot information
- Fix for random CTD on some spell display
- Fix for CTD when item missing in ItemDB
- Added command /SpellSlotInfo [#|"spell name"]. You can use this to see the spell slot
  information for any spell without having to right-click display through the MQ2ItemDisplay plugin.
- Ground spawn updates

18 Apr 2014 by eqmule
- Fixed a bug in GetSpellByID that would make it return "Unknown Spell" when it 
  should just return 0
  This means macros like scribe.mac will work again.

16 Apr 2014 by eqmule
- Fixed the EQRAIDWINDOW struct
  This means caption classcolors for raidmembers will again work as intended.
- Changed how plugins are loaded from MacroQuest.ini
  I don't think this will affect anyone, but from now on
  when a plugin is unloaded the [Plugins] section will not be erased
  The old mq2plugin=mq2plugin is still valid, but eventually
  you will end up with a list of plugins where the entries
  will look like mq2plugin=1 or mq2plugin=0
  I did this because I'm preparing the loader for being able to unload/load
  plugins directly from its iconmenu.

13 Apr 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Added GemIcon, HateGenerated, PvPCalc, Unknown182, Unknown222, Unknown223 to the SPELL struct
- Added HateGenerated to MQ2ItemDisplay output

11 Apr 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Merged the MQ2GearScore logic into the base code for MQ2ItemDisplay. This means that MQ2GearScore
  is no longer necessary and MQ2Bzsrch will work correctly for those that want scores.
  In order to use the new functionality, rename your old ini file to MQ2ItemDisplay.ini to get all
  the same values. You can stop using MQ2GearScore and go back to use the base code MQ2ItemDisplay

10 Apr 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Update of SpellSlotInfo for SPA's 124/125/132 to format as a ranged percent and specify that SPA 132
  is a # of tick(s)

08 Apr 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Rewrite of SpellSlotInfo, uses new function ParseSpellEffect. Pass a pSpell structure, slot number,
  character buffer and it will return a character buffer with the spell effect information
- Fixed issue with MQ2ItemDisplay that would sometimes display the wrong usable classes

08 Apr 2014 by SwiftyMUSE, eqmule
- Corrected datatype refactor to allow for correct type inheritence in MQ2 parser

08 Apr 2014 by eqmule
- Added MaxTargets to the SPELL struct
  This means we can check how many targets a spell will affect, 12 for example.
- Added SpellGroup to the SPELL struct
  This is used to display the spell family for the "Limit: SpellGroup"

06 Apr 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Fixed issues with GetSpellNameByID and GetSpellbyID that would cause undefined results or CTD

05 Apr 2014 by eqmule
- Fixed a crash in GetSpellEffectName
- MacroQuest2.exe should work on windows 8.x now

04 Apr 2014 by eqmule
- Update for patch

02 Apr 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- TEMPORARY fix for C2065 compiler issue on vs2008

02 Apr 2014 by eqmule
- Update for patch
- MacroQuest.ini is now created (from the _default template) if it doesnt exist.
- The item and spelldisplay plugin should display more correct info now
  SwiftyMUSE did most of that grunt work, big props to him for taking it on.
  We will carefully monitor this code and add more fixes as we go to make stacking
  and spell/iteminfo 100% perfect.

30 Mar 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Added CreateMQ2NewsWindow for Macroquest.ini file to turn on/off the creation of
  the news window
- Updated stacking checking to ignore bard songs and song window illusions
- Removed the stat change portion of the additional checks for stacking introduced
  on 23 Mar 2014

30 Mar 2014 by eqmule
- Fixed /lootall
- Added Caster to the Spell TLO
  returns a pStringType of the caster of a buff
  Usage: /echo ${Target.Buff[Ancient Flames].Caster}
  [MQ2] eqmule

27 Mar 2014 by CyberTech
- Refactor datatype definitions for MQ2 and ISEQ code
    All datatypes are declared in one file (DataTypeList.h), one time, for both ISXEQ and MQ2.
    Inheritance and Persistence are defined at the same time and location.
    This will avoid the ISXEQ build breaking or falling behind when new datatypes are added to MQ2.
    Additionally, it simplifies the code required for a new MQ2 datatype -- 1 line of code instead of 4

26 Mar 2014 by eqmule
- Fixed Spell[some spell].Description
  it now returns the correct string.
- Added a Slowed,Rooted,Mezzed,Crippled,Snared and Hasted
  to the TargetType TLO.
  they all return a pTargetBuffType TLO which has 3 members:
  Address (pIntType), Index (pIntType) and Duration (pTicksType).
  It also inherits pSpellType.
  This means that you can to stuff like:
  /echo ${Target.Slowed.Name} will fade in ${Target.Slowed.Duration.TotalSeconds}s
  [MQ2] Tepid Deeds will fade in 114s
  /echo ${Target} will break mezz in ${Target.Mezzed.Duration.TotalSeconds}s
  [MQ2] a_pyre_beetle48 will break mezz in 66s

24 Mar 2014 by eqmule
- Added exact match option to spawn searches (Suggested by: petesampras)
 example: /echo ${Spawn[=eqmule]} will find eqmule but not eqmulee.
- Fixed GroupMemberTargeted (this means /target clear works again)
- Added new TLO Member 'Inviter' to the character TLO. (its a pStringType)
 You can check ${Me.Invited} to see if you have a
 group invitation so I figured it would be useful
 to know who actually sent the invite:
 Usage: /echo ${Me.Inviter} just invited me to join their group
 Output: [MQ2] uberplayer00 just invited me to join their group

23 Mar 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Corrected itemdisplay to show useable classes for the spell when over level 70
- Corrected to make sure cfg files are executed during refresh injections
- Additional checks for spell stacking.
  (Buffs/Songs will stack (both land) if they are benefical spells and it's some type
  of stat change that was currently causing it to fail)

22 Mar 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Corrected useable class name in itemdisplay extension.
- Additional updates for spell effects
- Updates for spell stacking. Added .StacksWith as an alias
  for .WillStack

22 Mar 2014 by eqmule
-NOTE, THIS UPDATE WILL BREAK PLUGINS. (but not that much see below)
 SPELL struct member Level is now ClassLevel
 this was done cause i want you to know which plugins to update.
 ANY place that refers to Level-1 muct be changed to ClassLevel
 do NOT forget to remove the -1
-Updated the launcher.
-Injecting is now faster, it will happen even when eq is not in focus.
 This means injecting will no longer attach to any process it feels like.
 it will only attach to eqgame.exe.
 This is a good thing, (cause it means you wont have to kill the tasktray icon)
 if you need to /unload to do a rebuild for example.
 Also, since mq2main only attaches to eqgame, launchpad will now
 run just fine without dying even when the tasktray icon is up...
 If you /unload you can "reload" from the tasktray icon by selecting
 "Refresh Injections"
 If you start a new session of eqgame.exe mq2main.dll will be autoinjected.
 "Refresh Injections" will only reattach to eqgame.exe(s) that doesn't already
 have a mq2main.dll loaded in its address-space. 
 If one is loaded already it will move on to the next eqgame.exe it finds and try there
 until it has made sure all running eqgame.exe has mq loaded...

18 Mar 2014 by SwiftyMUSE
- Added CountSongs
- Changed .Stacks and .StacksPet to allow the comparison of the songs too
- Added MercType to the list of PlayerClasses
- Added the ability to allow custom offsets for those that need that (See the new privates files, MQ2Globals-private.cpp/.h)
- Added an actordef list to define the names for the various groundspawns.
  (If you find any missing (there are some), please post and they can be added.) Use "/items drop" to see
  the value that needs to be added. I removed the use of weapons.h and grounds.h. They were merged into
  the actordef list.
- Added some missing expansion names
- Added additional spelltype members (thanks PeteSampras)

18 Mar 2014 by eqmule
-IMPORTANT: MacroQuest.ini has been renamed to MacroQuest_default.ini
 I did this because I got tired of that unzipping would overwrite
 mine (which has custom settings in it) everytime there was a new zip.
 New Users that never run MacroQuest2.exe before
 SHOULD remove the _default extension on that file before they start MacroQues2.exe.
 (I want to make MacroQuest2.exe automatically do that at some point if no ini exist,
 but for now its a manual thing)
-Fixed a ctd when you did a /echo ${FindItemBankCount[blah]} with an empty shared bank...
-Fixed EQRAID struct (again)
-Added all known SPAs (458 of them), this means you should not get any more Unknown Spell Effects
 in the Spell Display. (You will get "Please Check" instead but thats for me
 so I know which ones I need to look closer at, dont worry about that for now.
-Added Spell restrictions as well to the spell display info - cred htw

-This is mainly a maintenance release, which means, it has code i am going to finetune later
 as well as some code that is now redundant and will be removed at a later point so we can avoid bloat.
 Hopefully releasing this now, will give those of you that maintain your own versions enough time
 to merge in the new stuff with your own builds before next patch...

-The Readme.chm file is back! (Click ReadMe on the macroquest2 icon...)
 it has compile instructions for VS 2012...

 more can be done to update other sections of it, but we need to start somewhere.
 contact me if you are interested in helping out with that.

16 Mar 2014 by eqmule
-Fixed EQRAIDMEMBER struct
 This means /echo ${Raid.Member[${Me}].Class} (and the likes) will work again.
-Fixed a bug with pRaidType where pSpawnType members wouldn't inherit correctly.
 This means things like /echo ${Raid.Member[${Me}].Race} will work properly (again)... (did it ever work?)

15 Mar 2014 by eqmule
-Fixed the EQRAID struct 
 This means, things like /echo ${Raid.Members} will work again.

13 Mar 2014 by eqmule
-Updated for patch
-Fixed a problem with MQ2Labels showing up as Unknown

12 Mar 2014 by eqmule
-Updated for patch
-The MQ2Type destructor is now virtual Cred: TypePun

09 Mar 2014 by eqmule
-Added Distance3D float member to the Switch TLO
-/click left item is back!! (in all its old days glory...)
 To use: first /itemtarget then /click left item
 Yes you can pick up stuff from the ground without facing it.
 Yes you can open a tradeskill container without facing it.
 BUT make sure you are in range. (20)
 Even though you do not have to be facing the item I still recommend
 you do a /face item (for appearances) before you issue a click left item...
 Please dont abuse this.

01 Mar 2014 by eqmule
-Fixed InvitedToGroup (it was in the wrong place in the struct)

26 Feb 2014 by eqmule
-Made some preparations for future updates related to Custom Help Windows
 Not a critical update unless you are a hardcore plugin author.

23 Feb 2014 by eqmule
-Corrected some offsets that where wrong.
 This should fix a couple ctd's reported on the forum (hopefully)
 Sorry about any downtime this may have caused to your crews...
-CampfireZone wont ctd in neigboirhoods or greater guild halls anymore
 however it wont return anything either until I figure out where that info is located.
-Updated /beepontells and /timestamp to take on AND off as arguments.
 no argument will just toggle, just like before this change.
 This is also saved to macroquest.ini from now on.

21 Feb 2014 by SwiftyMUSE, eqmule
- Updated for patch

20 Feb 2014 by eqmule
-Fixed EQRAID struct 
 This means, things like /echo ${Raid.Members} will again work.

19 Feb 2014 by eqmule
-Updated for patch
-Added LoreGroup and LinkDBValue to CONTENTS struct
 It is used in the linkdb plugin. Cred: SwiftyMUSE

-Added a new TLO Member for Song/Buff, HitCount which will return a pIntType of how many hits a song/buff has left before it fades.
 Usage /echo ${Me.Song[Lich Sting Recourse].HitCount}

-made some adjustments to /itemnotify
 Im not really finished with it, more testing is needed
 but now it can select items when merchantwindow is open.

 and /ctrl /itemnotify should pick up single items as well... *should*
 more to come on this, its complicated... I know the code looks like a complete mess
 but I will clean it up when I know exactly how I want it to work...

05 Feb 2014 by eqmule
-Changed /ini to work in the following way (see below), apperantly there was a bug in my understanding
 of how people wanted it to work.
//	/ini "someini.ini" "the section" "NULL" "NULL"
//	adds a key named NULL and a value named NULL under the [the section]:
//	to remove the key named NULL:
//	/ini "someini.ini" "the section" "NULL" NULL
//	OR /ini "someini.ini" "the section" "NULL"
//	to remove section "the section":
//	/ini "someini.ini" "the section" NULL
//	OR /ini "someini.ini" "the section"
//
//	Basically leaving the third and/or fourth parameter blank will be interpreted as NULL
//	enclosing NULL in quotes will interpret it as an actual string "NULL"

29 Jan 2014 by eqmule
-Fixed a bug in MQ2DataVars.cpp
 itemlinks now works as intended. (again)
-Added some support for ISXEQ and some new commands(/beepoontell,/timestamp) + a lineofsight code change
 cred: Red-One

28 Jan 2014 by eqmule
-Updated for patch

27 Jan 2014 by eqmule
-New Feature: /useitem "item name here"
-New Feature: /itemnotify "item name here" left/rightmouseup
 This means no more need to figure out which slot an item is in, as long as its in our inventory
 it will be "clicked".
 For obvious reasons, rightmouseup only works on clicky items...

-NOTE! MACRO AUTHORS:
Keeping with my modus operandi of "breaking things that are'nt fixed" (properly)
I have made changes to the following:
Macro breaking changes: (please dont panic, its easy to adjust)
1. TLO ${Me.XTarget[x].Type} is now ${Me.XTarget[x].TargetType}
 Reason: XTarget inherits Spawn and since that already contains a .Type member, it was necasary to change it.

2. Ok , so I noticed that everquest sometimes mark chat as SPAM
and in order to do that, they "tag" say,tell, and the rest of the chat if it orignates from another player.
This messes up our eventhandling, and I believe it has for several years.
So, its well overdue for a change, I am sorry about this though, cause this WILL
break some macros (and possibly plugins) that "fixes" this internally...
Here is an example of how a macro would deal with this:

#event healme "#1# says,#*#heal me#*#"

Sub Event_healme(line, Sender)
	/varset Sender ${Sender.Right[-2].Left[-1]}
	/if (${Sender.Equal[eqmule]}) {
		/echo eqmule needs a heal
		/varset healneeded 1
	}
/return

As you can see, unless we "strip" ${Sender} it will never be equal to "eqmule"
cause "eqmule" is actually "\x12\x31eqmule\x12"

Now, the fix for this obviously should be taken care of by core mq, and not your individial macros.
So I have done precicely that.
After building this version of mq, the new event should look like this instead:
Sub Event_tagged(line, Sender)
	/if (${Sender.Equal[eqmule]}) {
		/echo eqmule needs a heal
		/varset healneeded 1
	}
/return

Ok? questions? post on the forum, im releasing this version a month or so before next patch, 
so u should all have plently of time to adjust to this change.

22 Jan 2014 by eqmule
-Updated for patch

21 Jan 2014 by eqmule
-Added two new features
-New Command: /beepontells which is a toggle, can be set in MacroQuest.ini BeepOnTells=1 in the [MacroQuest] section.
 well... thats what it does, u get a tell... it beeps...
-New Command: /timestamp which is a toggle, can be set in MacroQuest.ini TimeStampChat=1 in the [MacroQuest] section.
 Basically it timestamps all chat when its on...
 NOTE: The timestamp takes place AFTER chatevents are handled, so at least in theory
 this should NOT have any adverse effects when turned on.

20 Jan 2014 by eqmule
-pinstCTaskWnd is back, dont know when it got lost...
-Added new TLO "Task" its useful for shared tasks(quests).
 it has the following members:
 -Title returns a pStringType of the shared task.
 -Timer returns a pTicksType of the amount of time left before task expires.
 -Members returns a pIntType of how many members the task has.
 -Member returns a pTaskMemberType
  pTaskMemberType has the following members:
  -Name returns a pStringType
  -Leader returns a pBoolType of TRUE or FALSE if the member is the task leader or not
  -Index returns a pIntType of the members taskindex, i.e where in the list it is... 1-6
Usage:
       /if (${Task.Member[Eqmule].Leader}) {
              /echo I am the leader of ${Task.Title} which expires in ${Task.Timer.TotalMinutes}...
	   }
	   /echo Task Member 2 is ${Task.Member[2]}
Output:
      [MQ2] I am the leader of Hatching a Plan which expires in 243 minutes...
      [MQ2] Task Member 2 is Eluidiaan

-XTarget now inherits pSpawnType
 this means that you can now do stuff like:
 /echo ${Me.XTarget[1].PctHPs}
 [MQ2] 93
 /echo ${Me.XTarget[8].Level}
 [MQ2] 16
 NOTE: max XTarget is 10... I dont think doing /echo ${Me.XTarget[11].Level} will turn out good for anyone...

 Please update ALL macros that targets mobs around you *when fighting* to check their HP to use XTarget[x].PctHPs instead.
 HINT: This is not a suggestion, its a very strong recommendation/borderline order.
 The reason for this is that:
 1. Targeting multiple mobs over and over just to check their HP, SLAMS the eq servers with targetpackets.
 2. It is BAD practice and it slows down YOUR macro, as well as the eq servers.
 3. For your own good, detecting botters are extremely easy by just watching how your character targets.
    no "real" player will target 50 mobs around him in a couple seconds, just to select the one with the lowest HP.

-Added ActiveDisc to the Character TLO, it returns a pSpellType if a discipline is active. (otherwise NULL)

 usage: /if (${Me.ActiveDisc.ID}) {
			/echo Yes I am using a Discipline, and its ${Me.ActiveDisc.Name}, the spell id is ${Me.ActiveDisc.ID}
		}

								HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!
We have had a good 2013, I expect to add some exciting new things as well as continue
work on updating and making MQ2 better and better this year.
Stay tuned, and thank you for all of your support!

-This is NOT a critical update (no need to update unless you really need the following:)
-Added GetCurrencyIDByName
-Added new Character TLO Member AltCurrency which returns a pIntType
 usage: /echo ${Me.AltCurrency[Marks of Valor]}
        /echo ${Me.AltCurrency[31]}
 Cred: desgn
-Added ZoneFlags to the pZoneType TLO, it returns a pIntType
-Added Category and Subcategory Members to the Spell TLO, they return pStringType
-Fixed a CTD in ${DisplayItem.StackSize}
-Added delete functionality to the /ini command
 usage: NULL required: http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=12574&highlight=delete
       no NULL needed: http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=18467

 Both approaches are valid and will work for backward compatability.

-This is NOT a critical update (no need to update unless you really need the following:)
 I just added FindItemByID and renamed FindItem to FindItemByName
-Updated ${Mercenary.State} to return "NOMERC" if you dont have a merc.

-There is a /while command in right now (has been for a while -pun intended)
 I just wasnt ready to announce it earlier, look, this is extremely beta.
 IF you are gonna try it, you cannot expect it to work perfectly
 I basically only tried:
 /while (${Target.ID}) {
	/delay 1s <--- IMPORTANT
	/echo Hi there we have a target
 }
 You can NOT do:
 /while (something) /echo hi there
 
 right now it NEEDS the {} enclosure...
 and please unless you want your cpu to freak out... use a "/delay something" within that closure...
 see my example above (the <-- IMPORTANT)

11 Dec 2013 by eqmule
-Updated for patch
-Updated AltAdvManager::GetAltAbility with second parameter, I dont know what it is yet, rank? level?
-Fix for SpawnInfo->Trader and SpawnInfo->Buyer

06 Dec 2013 by eqmule
-Fixed void CTabWnd::SetPage(int,bool,bool);
(this means aapurchase and the likes works again...)
your're welcome...

05 Dec 2013 by eqmule
-Updated for patch

27 Nov 2013 by SwiftyMUSE
-Added AAPointsAssigned to Me TLO

16 Nov 2013 by EqMule
-Fix for ${Target.AggroHolder} it now properly return Pets and Mercenary SpawnTypes as well as Players.
 There is still some work to do on this TLO, for example it wont return
 yourself, this is not intentional, its on my todo list.

-Added support for /itemnotify with bags closed for bank and shared bank as well.

-Fixed a bug where if you sent a /itemnotify in <pack> <slot> leftmouseup 
 and you had the item on a hotbutton, instead of picking it up, it would activate it.
 This means that from now on, if you issue a /itemnotify leftmouseup command... you can be 100% sure
 it WILL pick up the item, not activate it...

14 Nov 2013 by EqMule
-Updated for patch
-"/itemnotify in" changed to work even if bags are closed.
 example: /itemnotify in pack1 1 leftmouseup ( Will pick up the item in pack1 slot 1 even if the bag is closed...)

 Note: that this is pretty much untested right now, let me know of any issues.

10 Nov 2013 by SwiftyMUSE
- added MaxLevel to Spell TLO
  the purpose was to allow autobot to get the max mezz level automatically
  and avoid hardcoding it in the macro itself.

07 Nov 2013 by EqMule
-Fix for Contents.Power
-Added a manifest to MacroQuest2.exe so it will requireAdmin automatically.
-Updated all visual studio vcxproj files to use the v110xp toolset.

its time for you guys to update to vs2012 sp3 or newer if you want to use the vs2012 .sln
For the rest of you, this shouldnt have an impact, just use old MacroQuest2.sln

as for the strcpy_s error, this is intentional, upgrade your visual studio to a version released after 2006.
you cannot use vs 6.0 anymore (unless you change them all back to strcpy)

06 Nov 2013 by EqMule
-Updated for patch
- Changed top #turbo to 80, still defaults to 20
-Brought back an old friend from the dead... /click left door
 You do not *HAVE* to face the door to "click" it but I still recommend that you do, your char doesn't need the attention...
Usage:
Sub OpenDoor
:retrydoortarget
	/doortarget DOOR1
	/delay 1
	/if (!${Switch.ID}) {
		/goto :retrydoortarget
	}
	/face door nolook
	/delay 1
:retryopendoor
	/if (!${Switch.Open}) {
		/click left door
		/delay 1s
		/goto :retryopendoor
	}
/return

29 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Cast item works on items in bags now if you have VoA or higher expansion.
cred to desgn for code/suggestion

26 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Added a new member to the Target TLO:
${Target.AggroHolder} it returns a pSpawnType of whoever your target is most angry with and currently attacking, 
i.e they guy that has the most aggro.
This can be used for ANY Target, you dont even have to have aggro yourself or even be in group with them.
You can run by someone fighting, select their target and this will return whoever its most angry with...
/echo ${Target.AggroHolder}
[MQ2] EqMule

***OK THE NEXT FIX "might" break some macros, BUT, this is how it is meant to work for consistency, so... deal with it please.***
-Fixed ${Group.Member[<thename>].PctAggro and ${Group.Member[x].PctAggro
/echo ${Group.Member[eqmule].Index}
[MQ2] 3			<-- im groupmember 3
/echo ${Group.Member[3].Name}
[MQ2] Eqmule	<-- see?
/echo ${Group.Member[3].PctAggro	<-- it works with the number
[MQ2] 54		<-- my aggro
/echo ${Group.Member[Eqmule].PctAggro	<-- as well as the name
[MQ2] 54		<-- my aggro

23 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-NOTE TO: Macroauthors, Macro breaking CHANGE!

 Look, to prepare for a PctAggro fix, I needed to make a change to how ${Group.Member[<TheName>]} works
 This will most likely BREAK some people macros
 BUT it is going to be consistant with how other TLO's work that deal with Names and so on.
 so in the end you will thank me for making this change.
 From Now On: ${Group.Member[<TheName>} returns a pGroupMemberType NOT a pIntType
 SO IF you need the Index of a GroupMember, I have added a new member called: Index
 Example of how it worked BEFORE THIS PATCH:
 /echo ${Group.Member[${Me.Name}]}
 [MQ2] 0
 Example of how it works AFTER THIS PATCH:
 /echo ${Group.Member[${Me.Name}]}
 [MQ2] Soandso
 BECAUSE the new type is a pGroupMemberType, it also inherits pSpawnType which is why you can also do:
 /echo ${Group.Member[${Me.Name}].Class}
 [MQ2] Wizard
 I hope you all can see the benefit of being able to directly access the pSpawnType in this way...
 But, to get back to the index:
 To actually get the index do a:
 /echo ${Group.Member[${Me.Name}].Index}
 [MQ2] 0

 We good?

21 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Fixed ${Pet.Body.ID} and ${Mercenary.Body.ID} crashes (when no pet/mercenary was up)

20 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Added Prestige to the Item TLO:
usage: /echo ${Cursor.Prestige} returns a pBoolType TRUE if its a Prestige item otherwise FALSE

19 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Added Subscription to the Character TLO:
usage: /echo ${Me.Subscription} returns a pStringType "UNKNOWN","FREE","SILVER" or "GOLD"

15 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Added EnduranceCost to the Spell TLO:
usage: /echo ${Spell[Malarian Mantle].EnduranceCost} returns a pIntType
-Added PctPower to Item TLO:
usage /echo ${Me.Inventory[powersource].PctPower} returns a pFloatType

14 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Added 2 new Members to the Character TLO:
${Me.PctMercAAExp} which returns a float of the current percent of exp your mercenary has.
and
${Me.MercAAExp} which returns the actual pIntType

13 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Fix For macros not loading...

13 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Fix for ${Group.Member[x].Pet}

12 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Added Support for CustomPlugins.ini
 it only have 2 sections and in the Macroquest Section only DebugSpewToFile is valid
 in the Plugins section you can add as many plugins as u like...
 /plugin unload on a custom plugin will unload it (as it should), but it will NOT write the change to the CustomPlugins.ini.
 That behaviour is by design. If you dont want a plugin to be loaded, you should manually remove it from the list.
 Example of what my CustomPlugins.ini looks like:
 [MacroQuest]
 DebugSpewToFile=1

 [Plugins]
 mq2AutoLogin=mq2AutoLogin

12 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Fix for a crash in the "Clearing A Path" instance in Dead Hills
 this will most likely fix other instance crashes as well in the new zones.
 however i couldnt log in game to test, so report in bugs forum if u still crash
 when zoning in.

12 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Fix for ${Me.Pet.Following} and ${Me.Mercenary.Following}
-Todo: Fix ${Me.Inventory[powersource].Power}

11 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Removed PetTarget and PetCombat
-Added new TLO members for ${Me.Pet}
- Buff		example: /echo ${Me.Pet.Buff[1]} returns a pSpellType
			example: /echo ${Me.Pet.Buff[Spirit of Wolf]} returns a pIntType (The slot the buff is in)
- Combat	example: /echo ${Me.Pet.Combat} returns a pBoolType TRUE or FALSE (on/off)
- GHold		example: /echo ${Me.Pet.GHold} returns a pBoolType TRUE or FALSE (on/off)
- Hold		example: /echo ${Me.Pet.Hold} returns a pBoolType TRUE or FALSE (on/off)
- ReGroup	example: /echo ${Me.Pet.ReGroup} returns a pBoolType TRUE or FALSE (on/off)
- Stance	example: /echo ${Me.Pet.Stance} returns a pStringType "FOLLOW" or "GUARD"
- Stop		example: /echo ${Me.Pet.Stop} returns a pBoolType TRUE or FALSE (on/off)
- Target	example: /echo ${Me.Pet.Target} returns a pSpawnType of the pets current target
- Taunt		example: /echo ${Me.Pet.Taunt} returns a pBoolType TRUE or FALSE (on/off)

10 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Updated for patch
-Added new TLO ${Mercenary}
It returns a SpawnType so you have access to all spawnmembers.
As well as these four new ones:
${Mercenary.State} (stringtype) which returns strings: "DEAD" "SUSPENDED" "ACTIVE" or "UNKNOWN";
${Mercenary.StateID} (int) which returns the state as a number (mostly good for debugging)
${Mercenary.Stance} (stringtype) which return the Stance as a string
${Mercenary.AAPoints} (int) returns how many unspent mercenary AA you have.
I Plan to add more stuff later if needed. Those are the most useful for now...

09 Oct 2013 by EqMule
-Fix for Bank and SharedBank members in CHARINFO struct
(thanks to Drakhhen for making me aware of this bug)

08 Oct 2013 by EqMule
- Updated for Oct 7-8 2013 patch
- Shared Bank now has 4 slots
- I will add a TLO for the new mercenary AA
 but I need more time to look into it, unless someone beats me to it.
 For now use the UI...
- Added a couple new TLO's
 /echo ${Me.PetTarget}
 will return the spawn your pet has targeted.
 so you can do /echo ${Me.PetTarget.ID} and so on to get more info out... 
- /echo ${Me.PetCombat}
 is the pet attacking something? 
 returns TRUE or FALSE 

Im pretty sure these 2 can use some more work, but should work in most situations I think...

22 Sep 2013 by EqMule
- Added Me.ZoneBound which returns Zone information for the zone you are bound in
  Usage:
	/if (${Zone.ID}==${Me.ZoneBound.ID}) {
		/echo crap im back at bindpoint, did I die?
	}
18 Sep 2013 by EqMule

18 July 2013 by EqMule
- Added support for /useitem
  Example: /useitem ${FindItem[=worn totem].ItemSlot} ${FindItem[=worn totem].ItemSlot2}
  Note: you need VOA expansion or newer for /useitem to work, its a soe, not an mq2 command
- Fixed listselect *
	Example: /notify MMTW_MerchantWnd SubtypeListBox listselect 10
			 Will select the Tier V Healer listitem in the Mercenary Merchant Window.
	
	*listselect wasnt able to actually "select" items, it only "highlighted" them prior to this fix.
17 July 2013 by EqMule
- Added comboselect*
	Example: /notify MMTW_MerchantWnd TypeComboBox comboselect 2
			 Will select Journeyman Mercenaries in the Mercenary Merchant Window.
	
	*listselect still works when you just need to "set" an item in a combobox
	but when you want it to actually do the "select" use comboselect.

10 October 2008 by dkaa

09 October 2008 by ieatacid
- Changed target TLO. It now uses the new TargetType which inherits the spawn type.  The TargetType contains the following members:
   Buff (access to spell type): returns the target's spell by index (${Target.Buff[n]}) or name (${Target.Buff[name]}).  If no index is given (${Target.Buff}) it returns the first spell name or "NULL" if the target has no buffs
   BuffCount: returns the number of buffs on the target
   BuffUpdate: since there's a delay between when you target a spawn and when you get their buff data, this lets you know if the buff data is available

     ~ Example: echo ${Me.Name.Replace["Amadeus","Maestro"]}
                echo ${Me.Name.Replace[",","."]}  
* Added a custom 'label' that you can put in your macros -- ":OnExit".
  Anything included after that label will be called whenever an /endmacro
  command is issued.  To use this feature, the label must be at the end 
  of your 'Sub Main' function and end with a /return.  Please note that 
  this is NOT required of macros, so no macros will have to be altered 
  unless you wish to take advantage of this feature.  (See my posting
  on the messageboards for an example of how to use this.)

8 July 2006 by Amadeus
- Updated ISXEQ to compile a bit better with Visual Studio 2005
- Added ISXEQ project/solution file(s) for Visual Studio 2005.
  1. Double-click on "MQ2Auth.exe" (duh)
  2. Open Visual Studio 2005
  3. Click on File->Open->Project/Solution ..and select "ISXEQ-VS2005"
  4. Build All.
  5. The DLL files will be built in a directory in your primary MQ folder 
     called "ISXEQ Release Files".  Simply move all of the DLL files from
     that directory to your /InnerSpace/Extensions directory.
  ** You will get a few warnings; however, if your library/headers are set  
     up correctly and the ISXDK is installed properly, you should be able
     to compile out-of-the-box.
- Updated the VS2003 solution file ("ISXEQ") to include only ISXEQ projects
  and disable compilation of ISXEQLegacy (since it is currently broken).
- Please note that these VS2005 project files are only for ISXEQ.  If you
  still use MQ2, you can ignore this.

    Currently this works with your target that is engaged in combat. If it turns to flee
    this flag is set for use in macros. It checks to see if the heading of the spawn is
    facing in a direction that is not in an arc of 120 degrees facing you.
- If you are crashing on switching toons at character select,
  you can comment out the autorun (per character) section in
  MQ2Pulse.cpp. This is only needed if you want to automatically
  process commands upon initial entering of world for a
  character. If you don't use the feature commenting it out will
  not cause any lose of functionality for you. Please post any CTD
  crash dumps to assist with locating this bug.

22 November 2005 by SwiftyMUSE

  * int Select[value,...]
    This replaces ${String[ x y z ].Find[ ${Stuff} ]}, like so: ${Select[${Stuff},x,y,z]}
    The result will be 0 for none, 1 for the first, 2 for the second, ad infinitum (no limit)

  to verify that you own the aa prior to saying its READY. 
- Fixed Me.SpellReady

21 May 2005 by Amadeus
- The MQ command known as '/charinfo' is now known as '/char'.  This allows

- Added second project (ISXEQ.vcproj, no .dsp file at this time) to MQ2Main folder for 
  adaptation to Inner Space.  This project builds ISXEQ.dll and does NOT currently link (it
  compiles, then gives linker errors. some things need to be done before it will link)
  ISXEQ project needs separate implementations of each command, datatype, and top-level object.

- Cr4azyb4rd's code for the new item stuff, outlined in this thread:
  http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=10270
- The Item Datatype 'Stackable' seems to be broken at the moment.  We will be looking
  into it over the next few days.
- Added "GuildFavor" to the ItemDisplay plugin (Ziggy)
- Added Ziggy's /mapshow patch
- Added Cronic's new Plugin API additions: OnBeginZone() and OnEndZone().  Folks may want
  to bookmark http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=9959 as an example of how
  to add features to the plugin API.  (Hopefully this thread/example will make it in the 
  manual.)
- Added ${Me.EnduranceRegen} (submitted by Pooz).  It returns returns the amount of 
  endurance gained in the last tick. 

18 December 2004 by Amadeus
- Various structs/offsets taken from the boards to make MQ2 compatable

8 December 2004 by Lax
- Blech updated to version 1.6.1 which solves remaining known Blech issues

22 November 2004 by Lax
- Blech updated to version 1.6 which solves parsing problems such as the one
  described here: http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=75390#75390
- MQ2CustomBinds updated to solve a race condition issue, which also appears in
  older MQ2MoveUtils versions.  The race condition causes a crash when starting
  EQ via WinEQ 2.0
- The MQ2 initialization process now has a short delay to help alleviate the
  race condition issue for people who have not updated MQ2MoveUtils

25 October 2004 by Amadeus
- ${Me.AltAbility[]} is now back!   However, with one change.  Instead of 
  returning the 'rank', it now returns the total number of points you have
  spent in that ability.  Therefore, to determine if a player has bought an
  ability, all you have to do is check if the value is greater than zero.
- Added AALIST struct to eqdata.h and AA information to CHARINFO
- Fixed "/aa list xx" to stop showing multiple versions of the same AAs
- Fixed "/aa list timers" to only show AAs you have bought
- Added some new utility functions to the source (C++, NOT MACRO CODE)
  * bool PlayerHasAAAbility (PCHARINFO pChar, DWORD AAIndex);
  * PCHAR GetAANameByIndex(DWORD AAIndex)
  * DWORD GetAAIndexByName(PCHAR AAName)
  * DWORD GetAAIndexByID(DWORD ID)
~ User Submitted Fixes (from message boards)
  *  Add a "noauto" flag to your '/plugin' command to prevent 
     updating the macroquest.ini when a plugin is loaded/unloaded. 
  *  Added some more USERCOLOR_* definitions to eqdata.h
  *  Small fix to '/loadspells list'
  *  Added more spell information to the spell information display
  *  Added CastOnYou, CastOnAnother, and WearOff to the MQ2SpellType class
  *  Major upgrades to MQ2Irc plugin, see this thread for more information 
     http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=73390#73390
     
14 October 2004 by Amadeus
- Removed the BuildData datatype for the moment.  The code, as it was originally 
  conceived was causing compile problems on Visual Studio 6.0.  Moreover, it was 
  determined that it was not reliable on all partition types.   It may be added
  again at some point in the future after rigorous testing across different
  partition types and both vs 6.0 and vs.net compilers.

13 October 2004 by Amadeus
- [*LAX*]  New Memcheck0 routine
- [*DKAA*] New Memcheck4 routine (the routine previously known as memcheck4 
           is now memchecks)
- New offsets/structs for latest patch
- Con Colors should be working properly to lvl 70
- spawn.CleanName should now return the name without the '#' symbol
- More work on mq2map ...it's still in heavy testing and needs more work though
- Added 'BuildDate' to the MacroQuest data members.  Returns an int representing
  the date in which the current MQ2Main.dll was built.
- Added a short message to warn you of a running macro when /camping.

23 September 2004 by Amadeus
- Fixed the MacroQuest2.exe to have correct links and added a few new links!

19 September 2004 by Amadeus
- Fixes related to the extra buff slots and extra spell gem for Omens of War.

17 September 2004 by Amadeus
- MQ2Map has issues and is being debugged in house.  I suggest turning it
  off until it officially fixed if you are having problems.
- Added ${xxx.Attuneable} for items ..returns TRUE if item is Attuneable, 
  FALSE if it is not.
- Added some code to MQ2MapApi.cpp in the debugging stage.  Most of it is
  redundant code hoping to cut down on problems.
- Miscellanous fixes throughout the source

14 September 2004 by Amadeus
- All the fixes needed to make MQ2 work with Omens of War
- The way that EQ handles the initial splash screen has changed dramatically.
  MQ's custom SplashScreen is disabled.
- Almost all structs were modified/fixed.
- Removed the offset CEverQuest__GetTitleDesc
- Added Title to spawninfo structure
- Added ${xxx.Title} ..it returns a string that is your title.  Please note that 
  ${xxx.AATitle} will return the same thing.  I'm leaving both in for backwards
  compatability of macros although "Title" should be used in the future since 
  Titles are no longer exclusively AA based.
- updated TOTAL_SPELL_COUNT 
- Added TOTAL_SPELLS_ALLOCATED
- EQ_Character__Max_Mana removed ...it's a virtual function now (This means that 
  the MaxMana and PctMana datatypes are disabled for now)

26 August 2004 by Amadeus 
- Fixed /filter name on/off to work correctly [Efudd]

20 August 2004 by Amadeus
- Removed ${Me.GroupMember[]} and ${Me.GroupLeader} since it is already in as 
  ${Group[n].Name} and ${GroupLeaderName}.  Even though the information is stored in
  two locations, it was causing confusion.
- Tweaked ${Me.Grouped} some more ...I think I have it fixed now.

19 August 2004 by Amadeus
- Fixed ${Me.AltAbilityReady[]}
- Fixed ${Me.AltAbilityTimer[]}
- Added ${AltAbility[].MyReuseTime}  (proper reuse time if you hastened AA abilties)
- Added NEW COMMAND:  /aa
*** Syntax ***
/aa list all            -- lists all of your AA abilities in format [ID : name]
/aa list timers         -- lists just the AA you have that have timers
/aa info [ability name] -- gives information about a particular AA ability
/aa act [ability name]  -- works like "/alt act ##", but takes the name instead of ##
   (note:  You will notice a fraction of a second delay using this method vs.
           the /alt act ## method.)
***
(Note:  Yes, they do not list in any particular order (No, I don't know why).  No, 
I do not know why some abilities are duplicated.  Yes, it may have bugs 
that need testing.)
- Slight tweak to code to make it compile on Vc++ 6.0 cleanly
- Fixed GetSpellDuration (per corrections posted on the messageboard)
- Added an offset to eqgame.h and removed one from eqgame.h (Those that help find
  offsets..please note this change!)

18 August 2004 by Amadeus
- Fixed EQRAIDWINDOW and EQRAID structs
- Some tweaking to attempt to make ${xxx.Grouped} more consistant
- Added:  ${Me.GroupMember[n]}  (1-5) ...returns string
- Added:  ${Me.AmIGroupLeader}  ...return TRUE or FALSE
- Added:  ${Me.GroupList} ..simply returns a string of your group members (excluding you)
- Fixed ${xxx.Lore} for items
- Fixed {AltAbility[ability].xxx} ...all of these are now working
- Fixed All the AltAbility structs
(Note:  ${Me.AltAbilityReady.xxX}, ${Me.AltAbilityTimer.xxx} and ${Me.AltAbility[]} are 
        still BROKEN)
-----------
** SOE Coding Change (technical folks only)**  
EQ no longer stores information for ALL AA abilities in your memory space as it once did.
It allocates the space for all of the abilities;however, if your character is incapable of
using the ability, the pointer location for that ability is now 00000000.
-----------

14 August 2004 by Amadeus
- Fixed offsets to work with 8/13 "emergency" patch
- Updated TOTAL_SPELL_COUNT and MAX_ZONES

11 Auguest 2004 by Amadeus
- Fixed to work with the 8/11 patch

27 July 2004 by DKAA
- Fixed ${Plugin}

23 July 2004 by Amadeus
- Lots of struct updates from the boards
- Added the following variables:  ${Me.EnduranceBonus}, ${Me.CombatEffectsBonus},

  ${Me.StunResistBonus}, ${Me.StrikeThroughBonus}, ${Me.AttackBonus}, 
  ${Me.HPRegenBonus}, ${Me.ManaRegenBonus}, ${Me.DamageShieldBonus},
  ${Me.AttackSpeed}, ${Me.DoTShieldBonus}
- Added showbonuses.mac to the release/macros directory.  It will display your current
  stat bonuses as added by your gear.
- Added ${Me.LanguageSkill[languagename]} (ie, ${Me.LanguageSkill[Dark Speech]}.  You can
  also use a number (as given with /lang help) in place of the languagename parameter.

21 July 2004 by DKAA
- Fixed the macro not found error message.

18 July 2004 by Lax
- EQPlayNice 1.11+ compatibility

17 July 2004 by Amadeus
- Updated source to be compatable with the July 16 patch
- ${Me.AltAbilityTimer...} and ${Me.AltAbilityReady...} datatypes are broken atm and 
  have been disabled.

12 July 2004 by DKAA
- slot hand is now hands to be consistent
- updated some of the distributed macros

9 July 2004 by Lax:
- Newest version of the readme.chm from Wassup
- Added/changed MQ2Data type members
  int item.Tribute: Tribute value

3 July 2004 by DKAA
- added /who noguild

3 July 2004 by Amadeus:
- Added new command:  /substitute 
  ** Syntax: 
  **        - /substitute list
  **        - /substitute <orig> delete
  **        - /substitute <orig> <substitution>   (see examples below)
  ** This new command allows you to create custom midline substitutions that will work
  ** anywhere in a command.  It works VERY similarly to aliases in some respects, esp.
  ** in how it is saved in the .ini file and how the commandline syntax is structured. 
  ** Substitutes are called from any alias or commandline by using the percent sign (%)
  ** followed by your orig. text.
  **
  ** Examples:  "/substitute mom Mother"
  **            "/substitute omg Oh my god!"
  **            "/substitute k %omg, kill %t before I tell your %mom"
  **
  ** The final example if you typed "/say %k" would produce:  "/say Oh my god!, kill
  ** TARGET before I tell your Mother"
  **
  ** Please note the following rules/reminders:
  ** 
  ** 1.  You don't use the percent signs when creating the substitutions or editing your
  **     config file.
  ** 2.  You can use MQ's subsitutions without spaces around them (unlike EQs!) (ie: 
  **     "/echo %omg%mom" would return "/echo Oh my god!Mother"
  ** 3.  Substitutions do not currently work in macros.
  ** 4.  "/sub" is currently a valid shorthand for "/subsitute"
  ** 5.  You can use EQ's wildcards (ie: %t) within your substitutions; however, you 
  **     have to leave spaces around them (yes, they suck)
  ** 6.  You cannot CURRENTLY replace EQ wildcards with MQ substitutions (ie, you can't
  **     make a replacement for %m (This may be supported in the future.)
  **
- Fixed CONTENTS struct (thanks ieatacid)
- Fixed routines.mac, arrows.mac, and arraytest.mac (Dont_know_at_all)

2 July 2004 by Amadeus:
- Fixed "/who guild <guildname>" on some servers (It seems that on some servers, SOE
  removed guilds but left the entry giving bogus guild entries in the list where the
  'name' was blank, thus ending the search loop prematurely.)
- Added "/who knight"  (returns Paladins and Shadowknights in the zone)
- Added "/who tank"    (returns paladins, shadowknights, and warriors in the zone)
- Added "/who healer"  (returns druids and clerics in the zone)
- Added "/who dps"     (returns wizards, rangers, and rogues in the zone)
- Added "/who slower"  (returns shamans, enchanters, and beastlords in the zone)

30 June 2004 by Amadeus:
- Refined "/who npc named" to work a bit better
- Added "/who npc merchant"
- Added "/who npc tribute" (returns tribute masters)
- Added "/who npc gm" (returns GUILDmasters)
- Removed the Old SPAWNINFO struct

28 June 2004 by Lax:
- Added MQ2Data Top Level Object:
  bool LineOfSight[y,x,z:y,x,z]: Determines Line of Sight in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions.  Any not given will default to your character's current x y or z.
- Added MQ2Data type members:
  bool spawn.LineOfSight: Determines if your character has Line of Sight to this spawn
  bool switch.LineOfSight: Determines if your character has Line of Sight to this switch
  bool ground.LineOfSight: Determines if your character has Line of Sight to this ground item
- API now has static inline BOOL LineOfSight(PSPAWNINFO Origin, PSPAWNINFO CanISeeThis)

27 June 2004 by Amadeus:
- Added 'named' flag to the superwho filters.  It simply checks to 
  see if the spawn's name begins with a capital letter or with a
  pound (#) sign.  (examples:  '/who npc named', '/who npc named 65')
  ** This works best in places like the Plane of Hate.

23 June 2004 by Amadeus:
- ieatacid's CHARINFO update (primarily just offset locations updated)
- ieatacid's update to EQRAIDWINDOW struct
- Removed OLDCHARINFO struct

23 June 2004 by Lax:
- Fixed Bank stuff in CHARINFO
- "listselect" notify now works in combo boxes
- Fixed minor problem with operator precedence in Calculate (1-1-1 previously evaluated to
  positive 1, now it correctly evaluates to negative 1)
- Changed/Added MQ2Data members:
  int window.Items: Number of items in a list or combo box
  int window.List[text]: Find an item in a list or combo box by partial match (use window.List[=text] for exact)  Example: ${Window[TradeskillWnd].Child[RecipeList].List[=Inky Shadow Silk]}

21 june 2004 by DKAA:
- Fixed a crash in echo when the lines are longer than 2043

21 june 2004 by DKAA:
- Fixed the EQMERCHWND alignment and renumbered the CSIDLWND struct.

19 June 2004 by Lax:
- Fixed FastCalculate and EvaluateRPN functions.  Calculate works fine now, stfu rtfm etc ;)
- DKAA fixed some struct stuff
- Amadeus fixed some struct stuff

14 June 2004 by Lax:
- Replaced Calculate function with a much faster version. Also added an operator or two.
  I'll make sure they get added to the manual. How much faster? The existing calculate
  ran on my system 4,200 times in a short amount of time and took one full second of CPU
  time to do so. The same calculations ran with the new calculate 77,000 times and took 
  only 620ms. Extrapolating the data it would have taken about 124,000 times calling 
  calculate to match the old 4,200... or about 29.5 times faster (that's a lot).
- Added sub lookup map from Gus to speed up macros a little bit
- Undid MQ2EQBugFix, which was currently creating a bug (note to self: in future bug fixes,
  make sure it's only going to try to fix it for the correct version)
- Fixed an offset
- Standard search spawn now allows multi-word names.
- /mqlog no longer adds an extra line

3 June 2004 by Lax:
- Fixed string.Arg, string.Token, NearestSpawn, spawn.NearestSpawn, LastSpawn

2 June 2004 by Lax:
- Fixed some stuff, yadda yadda.  I forget now.
- Bodytype 10 has been identified as Dain, thank you for the reports

29 May 2004 by EqMule:
- Fixed EQ_INTERACTGROUNDITEM so click left item works again...
- Updated zipit.lst (personal reminder: dir * /s /N /A-D /B > zipit.lst)

28 May 2004 by DKAA:
- Fixed the message ID for mq2bzsrch.

27 May 2004 by Lax (more):
- Fixed stack overflow bug in one of the functions that handles window names.  I fixed it in one
  before putting up the update but didn't in an exact copy of it above it.  Lax truly lacks. ;)
- Added pet weapon procced pet body type to the list of known body types.
- Fixed captioncolors not working correctly
- /who <level> will work properly, as you would have expected previously.  e.g. /who 65.
  Coincidentally this now works with the other spawn searches, /who /target /highlight /mapshow
  /maphide, ${Spawn[search]} etc.

27 May 2004 by Lax:
- Added "chest" to the standard spawn searches used by /who, /target, /highlight, /mapshow, 
  /maphide, etc
- Fixed some problems with the window suff introduced in the May 16 zip
- Added/changed MQ2Data members:
  string spawn.Type: PC NPC Untargetable Mount Pet Corpse Chest Trigger Trap Timer Item 
- New MQ2Data Top-Level Object:
  int SpawnCount: Total number of spawns in current zone
  int SpawnCount[search]: Total number of spawns in current zone matching the search

24 May 2004 by DKAA:
-Fixed a couple problems with the makefiles (mq2chat wasn't building)
-A special update for mq2safe users

16 May 2004 by Lax:
- UI subsystem of MQ2 is now smarter.  All window and control names are now case insensitive,
  and controls can be used by ScreenID *or* Piece name.  /windows <windowname> now shows, for 
  each child of the given window, ScreenID, Piece name, and the TYPE of control (e.g. label,
  button, invslot, spellgem, etc).
- window.List now only works on list boxes (will not crash on other types, just give NULL)
- Added/changed MQ2Data members:
  string window.Name: Name of window piece (e.g. "ChatWindow" for top level windows, or the Piece name (NOTE: CUSTOM UI DEPENDANT) for child windows)
  string window.ScreenID: ScreenID of window piece (ScreenID is NOT custom ui dependant, this *must be* the same on ALL UIs)
  string window.Type: Type of window piece (Screen for top level windows, or Listbox, Button, Gauge, Label, Editbox, Slider, etc)
- Fixed /target next, as well as targeting the origin of the search (e.g. you, or the spawn
  already targeted)
- Fixed turbo problem with using /macro from within a macro

16 May 2004 by DKAA:
- Fixed a where using loc and radius in spawn searches would return spawns further than the radius

15 May 2004 by Lax:
- Fixed bug in /who that made it show no spawns for some people, even though there were spawns...
- Standard search spawns will accept class names or short names without using the "class" keyword.
  Shadowknight is used without a space, and short names are all 3 letters ("shd", not "sk").  
  Note that cleric's short name is "clr" not "cle".
- Bug with MQ2Chat plugin that caused events to be processed twice has been fixed
- MQ2IRC will now process all lines as custom events.  Note that it does not process them as 
  #chat events.
- Turned off the PCClass captioncolor option, PC caption colors will default to EQ's settings.
  It was left on by mistake after testing a bug fix.  You can turn them back on if you wish by
  using the /captioncolor command like so: /captioncolor pcclass on

14 May 2004 by Lax:
- MQ2ChatWnd (the MQ2 Chat Window support) got some upgrades.  First of all the window was not
  limiting the size of its scrollback, so after so much went on in the MQ2 window, your framerate
  would drop like a rock.  To achieve proper scrollback limiting without lagging you too much,
  I put in a system to make it buffer the chat that goes to it, and only display so many lines
  per frame.  The MQ2ChatWnd font size option now works somewhat...  The font sizes are not the
  same as EQ's chat window sizes yet, so be aware of that.  I'll work on it ;)  You will probably
  want somewhere from -3 to 2.  /mqfont <#>
- MQ2Map filters added: untargetable, trap, timer
- /who has been changed a little bit.  When a TRIGGER, TRAP, TIMER, or UNTARGETABLE is listed,
  that will be noted at the end of the line in red (very helpful).  The routine has also been
  updated for efficiency, so there is less lag with large /who result sets.
- Standard spawn searches (This includes /who, /target, ${Spawn[search]}, etc) have been 
  slightly modified.  "invis" is NO LONGER A VALID KEYWORD.  If you have this in macros, etc 
  you will need to change it.  The updated spawn types ARE valid keywords (trigger, trap, 
  timer, untargetable). If your search is for type "npc" you WILL get untargetable types in
  your search results (particularly helpful for /who).
- Added/changed MQ2Data members:
  string spawn.Type: PC NPC Untargetable Mount Pet Corpse Trigger Trap Timer Item 
  string string.Token[n,separator]: Retrieve a token from the string using a custom separator.  Unlike Arg, this will not skip empty values
  spell item.Spell: Spell effect
  float item.CastTime: Spell effect's cast time
  string item.EffectType: Spell effect type
  ticks character.AltAbilityTimer[n]: Alt ability reuse time left, by number
  ticks character.AltAbilityTimer[name]: Alt ability reuse time left, by name
- spawn.Hunger and spawn.Thirst have returned to active duty
- You can now list child windows from in-game with the /windows command, like so:
  /windows <name>
  e.g.: /windows InventoryWindow
- /itemnotify in <pack> <#> <notification>  now works with sharedbank slots.

13 May 2004 by Lax:
- Fixed "by class" caption colors
- Fixed some bodytypes being identified as triggers (note that untargetable NPCs *are* 
  triggers)
- Fixed target caption leakage (would stay drawn after switching targets)
- /who will show "invis" spawns if any parameters are given.  Spawn search functions,
  including /who and /target, will probably get updated soon.	
- Fixed problem with leading spaces in sub parameter declarations
- MQ2HUD now allows for different HUDs.  Each different HUD is stored in MQ2HUD.ini, but
  in different sections.  The default HUD is "Elements" because that's what it originally
  used.  To load a different HUD, the command is "/loadhud <name>" like "/loadhud bard".
  In this case, the [bard] section (not case sensitive, so it could also be [BARD]) of
  MQ2HUD.ini will be used.  To load the default HUD specifically, the command is 
  "/defaulthud".  MQ2HUD also now adds the following MQ2Data Top-Level Object:
  string HUD: Name of currently loaded HUD.
- MQ2FPS now fixes the bug where CTRL ALT and SHIFT keys stick when you switch windows.
  This is a bug in EQ that happens because the release of the key is not captured by EQ after
  it has been swapped to the background.  MQ2FPS now releases the keys as soon as EQ goes
  to the background, so this will no longer be an issue.
- New command to complement the /ctrlkey /altkey /shiftkey commands:
  Usage: /nomodkey <command>
  This command will release all ctrl/alt/shift keys for the duration of executing the 
  given command.
- Added/changed MQ2Data members:
  bool spawn.Anonymous: Anonymous?
  bool spawn.Roleplaying: Roleplaying?
  string string.Token[n,separators]: Retrieve a token from the string

12 May 2004 by Lax:
- Fixed the mysteriously disappearing #event handling in macros ;)

11 May 2004 by Lax:
- Added nifty changes.txt reader to character select screen.  Now you have no excuse!
- Fixed problem with events mysteriously having parameters disappear
- Updated Blech to fix a bug with some #events disappearing (and not firing)
- Your target's caption will now always be drawn
- Added LDoN Recruiters and Merchants to the list of full class names.
- Added /captioncolor command, which allows a lot of custom spawn caption coloring.  For example,
  the caption of marked NPCs or assist NPCs can be a specific color.. the caption of bankers and
  merchants can be a set color.  NPCs can be done by con color.  All spawns can be done by
  CLASS color (using the raid settings).  Note that you can only set the raid class colors right
  now through the raid options window.  You can open this window by typing
  /windowstate raidoptionswindow show
  Usage: /captioncolor <list|<name off|on|#>>
  Examples:
  /captioncolor list
  /captioncolor pcclass on
  /captioncolor pctrader on
  /captioncolor pctrader 255 128 0
- Changed /windowstate command to use the window mapping used by ${Window[name]}, /windows, etc.
- Fixed issues with "charm" and the invslot type
- raidmember MQ2Data type now inherits "spawn" (when they are in zone)
- Added/changed MQ2Data members:
  class raidmember.Class: Raid member's class (works without being in zone)
  int raidmember.Level: Raid member's level (works without being in zone)
  int item.WornSlots: The number of invslots this item can be worn in (fingers/ears count as 2 slots)
  invslot item.WornSlot[n]: The nth invslot this item can be worn in (fingers/ears count as 2 slots)
  bool item.WornSlot[name]: Can item be worn in invslot with this name? (worn slots only..)

10 May 2004 by Lax (more):
- Fixed once and for all the crash bugs relating to spawn captions (WHICH ARE *NOT* THE HUD)

10 May 2004 by Lax:
- Fixed problem relating to false negatives determining if a spawn is a TRIGGER (e.g. flavor
  text, trap, etc).  This solves crash issues in the latest zip with the custom caption
  system.  This also solves non-crash issues identifying "invisible spawns" in spawn searches,
  as well as spawns that were previously identified as NPCs in MQ2Map.

09 May 2004 by Lax (more):
- Fixed VS6 compile errors in Blech
- Fixed reported crash bug
- Fixed possible crash with HUDs
- Added MQ2HUD "type" 8, for character select screen.  This should fix some potential
  crashes when using custom HUDs and entering char select.

09 May 2004 by Lax:
- Removed remnants of MQ2Parms system.  Rest in peace.  Phase 4.
- Cleaned up a lot of old code that was being kept in comments
- Removed mount captions, they just crash the client
- Added optional parameter to /delay.
  Usage: /delay <time> [condition to end early]
  This lets you use a delay that has a possibility to end early.  For example...
  /keypress forward hold
  /delay 1s ${Spawn[1234].Distance}<${Spawn[1234].MaxMeleeTo}
  /keypress forward
- New command /noparse
  Usage: /noparse <command>
  Prevents a command from being parsed for MQ2Data.  For example..
  /noparse /ini blah blah blah ${stuff}
  Will actually write the ${stuff} literally instead of changing it to the current value
  of stuff.
- Added/changed MQ2Data members:
  int macroquest.MouseX: Mouse's x location
  int macroquest.MouseY: Mouse's y location
  string ticks.Time: Time in the form mm:ss
  string ticks.TimeHMS: Time in the form hh:mm:ss (if there are no hours, the form will be mm:ss)
  int character.CountBuffs: Total number of buffs (not including short duration buffs)

07 May 2004 by Lax:
- Added "Lax/Blech" support to custom events.  The Blech system allows much easier parsing of
  incoming chat.  Custom events will now support more parameters that are automatically
  parsed based on the match text.
- Fixed up EQ's handling of spawn captions (name above their head). Only the nearest 35 spawn
  captions will be updated by default (and even then, only those close enough that you'd see 
  their name).  EQ itself constantly updates the name of every spawn in the zone, even though 
  only a small portion of those are displayed.
- Added an option to /caption command
  Usage: /caption <list|type <value>|update #>
  "/caption update #" will set the number of nearest spawns for MQ2 to update the name of
  each pass.  By default, this is 35.  If you have performance issues after this update,
  please post about it on the forums.  Find a happy update number and let us know.
- Added marked NPC and assist target leadership stuff to default captions, also put guilds on
  the line below the name.  The defaults should mostly look like EQ's now.
- Fixed macro.Params
- Fixed invslot names
- Added/Changed MQ2Data Members:
	spawn character.TargetOfTarget: Target of target   (moved to character type)
	bool spawn.Assist: Current Raid or Group assist target?
	int spawn.Mark: Current Raid or Group marked npc mark number (raid first)
	spawn character.RaidAssistTarget[n]: Current raid assist target (1-3)
	spawn character.GroupAssistTarget: Current group assist target
	spawn character.RaidMarkNPC[n]: Current raid marked NPC (1-3)
	spawn character.GroupMarkNPC[n]: Current group marked NPC (1-3)

05 May 2004 by Lax (even more):
- Plenty of positive feedback on the custom spawn captioning.  Plenty also asking why shownames
  was not working properly.  There are now 4 levels of captions for Players, according to the
  shownames level, to solve this issue.  Therefore the ini options are now Player1, Player2, 
  Player3, Player4 rather than just Player.  Also, the guild status indicator now 
  capitalizes Leader and Officer, and added a "LDR" tag to your group leader.
- Added /caption command to set the custom captions from in-game.
  Usage: /caption <list|type <value>>
  To clear the specific setting, just do /caption <type> like so:
  /caption player1
- DKAA fixed the bzsrch problems
- Added MQ2Data member:
  bool spawn.GroupLeader: Is this your group's leader?
- Fixed CHARINFO struct.  Some Stuff appeared slightly wrong, like leadership exp and bank
  stuff.

05 May 2004 by Lax (more):
- Fixed crash on zoning relating to the new HUD functionality. Dont ask.

05 Max 2004 by Lax:
- Updated for patch and added README.CHM.  Keep an eye out, we should have the manual
  available in more formats (including printable) soon

04 May 2004 by Lax:
- New command
  Usage: /hud <normal|underui|always>
  * "Normal" will make the HUD display as it would normally on top of UI, not at char select
     or in "f10 mode"
  * "UnderUI" will make the HUD display as it would normally except UNDER the UI, and not at
     char select or in "f10 mode"
  * "Always" will make the HUD display under the UI, at char select, and in "f10 mode"
- New Plugin MQ2HUD.  Edit MQ2HUD.INI to add custom elements to your HUD.  You pick the spot
  on the screen, the color, and what gets displayed.  Every element gets parsed for MQ2Data
  each time it is displayed.
  Example MQ2HUD.INI:
    [Elements]
		TargetInfo=3,5,35,255,255,255,${Target}
		GMIndicator=3,5,45,0,0,255,${Spawn[gm]}
		CursorItemName=7,-15,-15,255,255,255,${If[${Cursor.ID},${Cursor},]}
		ClickMeForFun=6,-25,-25,255,255,255,${If[!${Cursor.ID},click me,]}
  The order is TYPE,X,Y,RED,GREEN,BLUE,TEXT.
  Type is currently any combination of the following:
    1 - Display in non-full screen mode
    2 - Display in full screen mode ("f10 mode")
    4 - X,Y is based on cursor location
  e.g. 1+2+4=7.  7 means all 3 of the above. 6 means 2 and 4. 3 means 1 and 2. Just add them
    together.  There is no way to end up with a number that could mean two different 
     combinations.
  Red, Green and Blue are each from 0 to 255. 255,255,255 is white, 0,0,0 is black.
  ** There is currently not a command to add or remove these from inside the game.  One will
     probably be added soon.  The plugin will automatically re-load the list from the .ini
     when you modify and save the .ini.
- Seeing as how the mouse functions perfectly fine in full screen mode, I've forced the cursor
  to display the same as it would in UI-visible mode.  The only difference is the item is not
  displayed on your cursor.  With MQ2HUD and the "CursorItemName" example, you could have it
  show the name of the item attached to your cursor in full screen mode (use type 6 if you
  want it to follow your cursor in full screen mode only).
- Added custom spawn captioning.  Set them in MacroQuest.ini [Captions].  Empty the setting 
  to make it use EQ's default.  By default our player caption is slightly different -  
  it shows their guild status if they are officer or leader of a guild.  Pet captions are a
  little different also - it will display the name of its master if it is a player's pet.
  Use "\n" to mean a new line when setting captions.
- Added MQ2Data Top-Level Object:
  spawn NamingSpawn: Spawn currently being captioned.  NULL when not captioning.
- Added/changed MQ2Data members:
  bool spawn.LFG: LFG?
  bool spawn.Linkdead: Linkdead?
  bool spawn.Trader: Trader?
  bool spawn.AFK: AFK?
  string spawn.AATitle: Actual AA title (e.g. Sage, Impresario, etc)
- MQ2Map adds Top-Level Object: spawn MapSpawn: If your cursor is on a spawn on the map, this is it
- Fixed ticks.Time

02 May 2004 by Lax:
- Added a popup box to the crash detected hook, explaining that the user should visit the
  MQ2::Bug Reports forum.
- Removed EasyDetour and EasyClassDetour.  There is a single replacement for the both of them
  called EzDetour.  EzDetourwName(offset,detour,trampoline).  Examples (which are all over in MQ2Main
  and plugins):
  EzDetourwName(ProcessGameEvents,Detour_ProcessGameEvents,Trampoline_ProcessGameEvents);
  EzDetourwName(CEverQuest__EnterZone,CEverQuestHook::EnterZone_Detour,CEverQuestHook::EnterZone_Trampoline);
- Renamed the REVERSE_DETOUR functions to reduce confusion.  These really had nothing to do
  with detours.  What it really does is lets you call a function at a given offset.  
  So, they are now:
  FUNCTION_AT_ADDRESS(function,offset)
  FUNCTION_AT_VARIABLE_ADDRESS(function,variable)
  FUNCTION_AT_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS(function,offset)
- Fixed small issue in MQ2Data parser
- Fixed /memspell not finding some spells correctly (Heroic Bond for example)
- MQ2 will now fix the string table by removing extraneous spaces from the end of strings,
  since EQ isnt smart enough to do it itself.  This fixes issues such as finding the AA
  "Bestial Alignment", which has two spaces after it in eqstr_us.txt.  
  ${AltAbility[Bestial Alignment]} previously did not work because of this issue.  It works
  now because of this fix.
- Added MQ2Data types
  raid, raidmember   (see reference for members)
- Added MQ2Data Top-Level Objects
  raid Raid: Raid you're in...
- Added/changed MQ2Data members
  string ticks.Time: Time in the form hh:mm:ss (if there are no hours, the form will be mm:ss)
  int skill.MinLevel: Minimum level for your class
  int skill.StartingSkill: Base skill level for your class
  int skill.SkillCapPre50: Skill cap pre-50 for your class
  int skill.SkillCapPost50: Skill cap post-50 for your class
  int character.FreeInventory: Count of free inventory spaces
  int character.FreeInventory[n]: Count of free inventory spaces of at least this size (giant=4)
  int character.LargestFreeInventory: Size of largest free inventory space
- LaxColor is now defaulted to off since most people now realize that it exists.  If you wish
  to turn it back on, LaxColor=1 in MacroQuest.ini.
- Fixed spawn.NearestSpawn issues
- Fixed ${Ini} absolute path issues
- Fixed some other issues that were brought up on the boards

30 Apr 2004 by Lax:
- Added MQ2Data members
  int macro.Params: Number of parameters to current sub

29 Apr 2004 by Lax (even more):
- Added option so that MQ2Data errors and normal errors (but not syntax errors that show
  /usage etc) will dump the macro stack.  This is ON by default.  To turn it off, set
  AllErrorsDumpStack=0 in MAcroQuest.ini section [MacroQuest]
- Added option so that the above errors will end the macro, aka makes them "fatal".  This is
  OFF by default. To set this, set AllErrorsFatal=1 in MacroQuest.ini section [MacroQuest]
- If for some reason you need to clear all GLOBAL SCOPE variables,
  /deletevar * global
  will do the trick.  For example, after you try to run an old macro and then realize the
  global scope changed and /zapvars no longer exists, but you can't make the variables outer
  scope because theyre already in global scope and you dont want to delete them all one by
  one....
- Perfected Multi-dimensional arrays

29 Apr 2004 by Lax (more):
- Fixed Multi-dimensional arrays

29 Apr 2004 by Lax:
- Fixed SPAWNINFO structure.
- NOTICE: Some MQ2Data members are currently MIA.  They may come back soon.  These include:
  character.Hunger
  character.Thirst
  character.GukEarned
  character.MMEarned
  character.RujEarned
  character.TakEarned
  character.MirEarned
  character.LDoNPoints

27 Apr 2004 by Lax (more):
- MQ2DataVars is now default.  Share and enjoy, share and enjoy!
- Fixed timer type member availability
- Added MQ2Data type: altability
- Added MQ2Data Top-Level Objects:
  altability AltAbility[n]: Alt ability by number
  altability AltAbility[name]: Alt ability by name
- Changed/Added MQ2Data Members:
  float spawn.MaxRange: Max distance from this spawn for it to hit you
  float spawn.MaxRangeTo: Max distance from this spawn for you to hit it
  int character.AltAbility[n]: Alt ability rank by number
  int character.AltAbility[name]: Alt ability rank by name
  bool character.AltAbilityReady[n]: Alt ability readiness by number
  bool character.AltAbilityReady[name]: Alt ability readiness by name
  int character.AltAbilityTimer[n]: Alt ability reuse time (seconds) left by number
  int character.AltAbilityTimer[name]: Alt ability reuse time (seconds) left by name
  spell character.CombatAbility[n]: Combat ability by number in your list (not same as others lists!)
  int character.CombatAbility[name]: Combat ability number in your list by name (not same as others lists!)
- Added an option to MQ2Map:  The "TargetMelee" mapfilter when set to 1 will draw a circle 
  representing how close to this spawn you must be to hit it.  Set to anything but 0 or 1 
  will draw a circle representing how close to this spawn you must be for it to hit you.
- Added some flavor for error messages.  Set LaxColor=0 in MacroQuest.ini [MacroQuest] to
  disable.  It's on by default or it wouldn't be as fun.

27 Apr 2004 by Lax:
- spawn.MaxRange now uses the proper melee range algorithm
- Fixed a crash bug in the Ini TLO
- Added proper relative/absolute path detection to /ini
- Fixed window.Checked
- Added MQ2Data members:
  int window.Style: Window style code
  bool window.Enabled: Enabled?
  bool window.Highlighted: Highlighted/mouse over?

26 Apr 2004 by Lax:
- Various error messages have been updated to be more specific.
- Fixed "outer" scope not being cleared by /endmacro.  Removed /zapvars in MQ2DataVars 
  since all it did was clear the outer scope.  It's no longer needed because the old global
  scope is separated into two scopes in MQ2DataVars.
- Fixed FindInvSlotForContents function (used in item.InvSlot.  item.InvSlot will no longer
  give NULL for valid items in your inventory/bank)
- Sub parameters (including those for events) are now allowed to have a type other than 
  string, when MQ2DataVars is enabled, like so:
  Sub MySub(int A, string B, float C)
- Fixed out-of-bounds by 1 crash in MQ2DataVar arrays
- MQ2FPS now allows you to disable the framerate display with /fps off (/fps on to enable again)
- MQ2EQIM feature set adjusted.  Now keeps your list of buddies (per character) and the last
  time they were seen online or on eqim (by any character).  Your friends list is automatically
  added as buddies.  A member was also added to the "buddy" type EQIM adds, time buddy.LastSeen.
- ${Ini} will allow either relative or absolute paths.  Also slightly modified what it gives
  you when you try to get a list of keys and supply a default (previously it would ignore
  the default and give NULL if there was no list).
- Improved parsing of " and ] within MQ2Data indexing.
  ${String["hi"]}: hi
  ${String["hi","hi"]}: hi,hi
  ${String[""hi""]}: "hi"
  ${String[hi"hi"hi]}: hi"hi"hi
  ${String[[MQ2] - Hi]}: [MQ2] - Hi
  ${String["""]}: "
- MQ2BzSrch plugin is now updated for MQ2Data.
  MQ2Data reference for MQ2BzSrch (because it's a plugin, not in main reference)

25 Apr 2004 by Lax (revision C changes):
- Fixed merchant.Item[=name] and corpse.Item[=name]
- Fixed character.PctEndurance
- Fixed problems with tabs in macros, and also with leading and trailing whitespace
- MQ2DataVars is READY.  Keep an eye out for important announcements about this!
- Added MQ2Data types for MQ2DataVars: array, timer

25 Apr 2004 by Lax (even more):
- Hopefully fixed crash caused by fixing the "LastCommand" stuff...
- Added MQ2Data Members:
  int character.MaxEndurance: Max endurance
  int character.PctEndurance: Percent endurance

25 Apr 2004 by Lax (more):
- Fixed spawn.NearestSpawn
- Changed buff.ID so that it gives the song # or buff # instead of the spell's ID

25 Apr 2004 by Lax:
- Fixed once and for all the /itemnotify and /notify crashes
- Fixed the rendering rate defaults (will no longer flicker like a strobe light ;)

23 Apr 2004 by Lax (more):
- Added MQ2Data Type:
  skill (see reference for members)
- Added MQ2Data Top-Level Objects:
  string GroupLeaderName: group leader's name (works even if they are out of zone)
  spawn GroupLeader: group leader (only works if they are in zone)
  skill Skill[n]: Skill by number
  skill Skill[name]: Skill by name
- Added/Changed MQ2Data Members:
  spawn spawn.NearestSpawn[search]: Find the nearest spawn matching this search, to this spawn (most efficient on yourself)
  spawn spawn.NearestSpawn[n,search]: Find the nth nearest spawn matching this search, to this spawn (most efficient on yourself)
  string window.List[n]: Get the first-column text for the nth item in a list box.  Example: ${Window[TradeskillWnd].Child[RecipeList].List[1]}
  int window.List[text]: Find an item in a list box by partial match (use window.List[=text] for exact)  Example: ${Window[TradeskillWnd].Child[RecipeList].List[=Inky Shadow Silk]}
  int string.Count[char]: Count the number of occurrences of a particular character in the string
  bool window.Checked: Checked? (useful for buttons)
  string string.Left[-length]: The left ("all but" length) of the string.. Left[-1] of "Left" will be "Lef"
  string string.Right[-length]: The right ("all but" length) of the string.. Right[-1] of "Left" will be "eft"
  bool character.RangedReady: Ranged attack ready?
  bool character.AltTimerReady: Alternate timer ready? (Bash/Slam/Frenzy/Backstab.  Note that AbilityReady works fine with most of these)
  int macroquest.Running: Running time of current MQ2 session, in milliseconds
- Fixed AbilityReady for the alternate timer abilities (Bash, Slam, Frenzy, Backstab, possibly others)
- Fixed /ctrlkey /shiftkey and /altkey.  They would sometimes "stick" the key down.
- Added a notification to /notify "listselect", used to select the nth item in a list box.
  Example: /notify TradeskillWnd RecipeList listselect 1
  Use 0 to clear your selection.
- ${Group[0]} is now the same as ${Me}.  Group members are still 1-5.
- Added command to MQ2FPS:
  /render <fg|bg> <#|~#>
  Sets the foreground or background rendering rate.  This is how many out of n frames MQ2FPS
  will allow to be drawn.  You keep moving full speed, the client responds to mouse or keys,
  the UI is still drawn... but, the world itself will not be drawn as often.
  Use with ~ to draw n-1 out of n frames, or without to draw 1 out of n frames.
  e.g. /render bg ~3 will draw 2 out of 3 frames.  /render bg 3 will draw 1 out of 3 frames.

23 Apr 2004 by Lax:
- Changed top #turbo to 40, still defaults to 20
- Fixed Ini Top-Level Object again
- Fixed "enviro" slots so that they work for enviro1-10 not just 1-8

22 Apr 2004 by Lax:
- Readme.html has been removed from the zip by request of its author.  It is being worked on
  and will return.
- /selectitem GONE
- /finditem GONE
- /click functionality has been SEVERELY reduced.  It will now function given an x,y,
  and on an item or spawn (target).  Upgrade to /notify for UI interaction.
  /notify <window> <button screen id> <notification>
  example:
  /notify LootWnd DoneButton leftmouseup
  Window names and control ScreenID's are found in the XML files, and are NOT screwed up
  by custom interfaces (unless your UI does not have the button)
- Fixed item slot name discrepancies.  What was previously "primary" and "secondary" is
  "mainhand" and "offhand".  It was one thing in some places, but not in others.  Should
  be all the same now.
- Underscores(_) are again valid in variable names
- Added "STUN" to spawn.State
- Fixed Ini Top-Level Object

  track of your buddy list and adds a MQ2Data type and Top-Level Objects:
  ** buddy type
  Members:
  ...string Name: Buddy's name (may be fennin.Name or just Name, depending on how you added them)

- Changed "character" member "PlatShared" to "PlatinumShared"

19 Apr 2004 by Lax:
- ** MQ2DATA PHASE TWO ** If something is missing from MQ2Data it's because you never opened
  your damn mouth.  If you need something in MQ2Data whether it was previously available or
  not, speak up.  You're on your own if you want to figure out how to enable MQ2Parm at this
  point, good luck (I'm making it difficult on you so you will get your ass in gear)!  The
  readme is not yet updated.
- Fixed alerts being missing from SpawnMatchesSearch.  They worked in some spawn searches but
  not others.
- character.Inventory now uses the same numbering as InvSlot
- Added/changed MQ2Data members

15 Apr 2004 by Lax:
- Fixed /destroy crash
- Fixed "random" crash on zoning with MQ2Map loaded, due to a bug in the recently revised ConColor
- Fixed /cast issue casting "Bane" instead of "Bane of Nife" etc
- Fixed spell manager structure
- Fixed /doortarget id #, which would invariably crash
- Fixed and changed /keypress so that it also accepts key combinations, and will not crash no matter how hard you try.
  /keypress with key combinations will have the same effect as /keypress using the command name, it will not
  type the key into the chat window.  If you need to type into a window specifically (chat windows, social edit, etc)
  /keypress <key> chat
  example: /keypress e chat
  Note that you cannot use both hold and chat, and chat is only valid for the key not a command name.
  ** /sendkey and /press will give a warning the first time per session they are used that they are
     now completely obsolete and you should switch to /keypress.  they will be removed soon.
- Fixed and tested "heading" type's "To String"
- /newif will no longer quietly execute the "false" branch when it fails to parse the conditions.  The conditions
  after parsing MQ2Data/MQ2Parm will be displayed in an error message, and the macro will end.
- Other minor issues fixed

14 Apr 2004 by Lax:
- Fixed MQ2KeyBinds
- Fixed MQ2ChatWnd.ini

13 Apr 2004 by Lax:
- Fixed ! in Calculate (worked most of the time, but not in some special cases)
- Fixed heading's "To String" to give the correct heading.  heading.Name/heading.ShortName were fine
- Fixed time.Time12 to be 12 hour (oops)

9 Apr 2004 by Lax:
- Fixed != in Calculate (and therefore in /newif, math.Calc, etc), and implemented ! as
  the unary NOT operator.  This gives 0 if your calculation is non-zero, or 1 if your
  calculation is zero.
- MQ2Data changes:
  -- Swapped Y and X back to being backwards-backwards or backwards-forwards, or whatever they
     originally were
  -- Added "NWU" coordinates (North/West/Up), the three positively oriented directions in EQ.  
     Spawns also have a shortcut for SED (South/East/Down).  All type member names involving 
     XYZ have a NWU complement (none necessary for the "index" bracketed part, of Heading[y,x] 
     for example)
  -- Fixed character.AbilityReady
  -- Fixed item (TO STRING)
  Top Level Objects
  * spawn LastSpawn: The last spawn chronologically.

- Item links were apparently not working in the MQ2ChatWnd, nobody reported this until now.
  Thanks people who noticed it and never reported it!  Anyway, item links in MQ2ChatWnd are
  simply stripped until I figure out the issue.  Item links in MQ2Chat still work fine.

8 Apr 2004 by Lax
- MQ2Data changes:
  - macro.Defined is now a top level object instead
    bool Defined[name]
  - Fixed all variable parsing when MQ2Parms is not on
- Fixed a major problem with /newif, should now "work as intended"
- Fixed (I think) problem with /face which let the macro continue before facing the target
  completed

7 Apr 2004 by Lax
- Changes to MQ2Data system:
  *** NOTICE: All X and Y coordinates used by the MQ2Data system have been REVERSED.
      Internally, MQ2 stays the same as it has been forever.  However, you will now
      notice that "/echo ${Me.X}, ${Me.Y}, ${Me.Z}" will give the same order as seen
      by typing /loc
  Top level objects:

  *** Special handling is used for casting to "type", such that the new data is equal 
      to the old type, and the new type is "type".
  -- Fixed type casting so that members of the new type may be accessed as expected (this
     was incorrectly ending the parsing at the type cast until now)
- ConColor changed to take 1 parameter
- FindMount tweaked/inlined
- Changed the "RunNextCommand" to remain to TRUE until set to FALSE, so only cases where
  the next command should not be run need to be explicitly set (this should increase
  macro performance in most cases, but some commands may need to be correctly updated)
- /declare will no longer spam you if the variable previously existed.  If the variable
  previously existed, it will be quietly deleted and replaced by the new one.  This might
  cause some people problems but they will learn quickly ;)
- New command /deletevar <name> - Deletes an existing variable.  Gives a message if the
  variable did not exist, but no message if the variable did exist.
- /notify modified to work for clicking off buffs and other things it would not previously
  work for.  However, items must still be clicked using /itemnotify.  /notify now accepts
  all of the same clicks as /itemnotify (leftmouse,leftmouseup,leftmouseheld,etc)

31 Mar 2004 by Lax (more)
- Fixed character member PctExp
- Added character members:
  float PctAAExp: % AA exp..
  bool Moving: Moving? (includes the mount hack so you're not constantly "moving" when sitting on a mount)
- Added spawn members:
  bool Swimming: Swimming?
  bool Underwater: Underwater?
  bool FeetWet: Feet at least wet?
  int Animation: Animation id
  int Holding: Holding id
  float Look: Look angle
- Added "gm" to standard searchspawn, works with anything that uses that including MQ2Map commands,
  /target, ${Spawn[search]}, etc
- Modified the if block parsing in FailIf so that it only looks for } and { as the first and last characters on a line

31 Mar 2004 by Lax
- Fixed /newif so variables/parms/data get parsed
- string.Mid and string.Find are now 1-based instead of 0-based
- Calculate (and stuff that uses it) now supports parentheses, and will treat 
  "NULL" and "FALSE" as 0, and "TRUE" as 1
- Added float math.Distance[x,y,z:x,y,z]: Performs distance calculations in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions.  Any not given will default to your character's current x y or z.

30 Mar 2004 by Lax
- Added a distance-sorted spawn list in MQ2Main
- Added MQ2Data top-level object:
  * spawn NearestSpawn[n]: The nth nearest spawn
  * spawn NearestSpawn[search]: The nearest spawn matching this search (same as Spawn[search])
  * spawn NearestSpawn[n,search]: The nth nearest spawn matching this search

29 Mar 2004 by Lax (even more)
- Added /ctrl /alt and /shift commands:
  /ctrl <command>
  /alt <command>
  /shift <command>
  These execute a command while telling the window manager that a key is pressed.  This can
  be used in conjunction with /itemnotify to pick up a stack or a single item... example:
  pick up a single item from a stack: /ctrl /itemnotify pack1 leftmouseup
  pick up an entire stack: /shift /itemnotify pack1 leftmouseup
  Because they execute a command, they can also be used together, as in 
  /ctrl /alt /shift <command>...
- Fixed character.Buff[slot]
- Fixed character.Gem[name]
- Fixed If top level object crashing on false
- Added MQ2CHAT bind to start typing in the MQ2 Chat Window, also added MQ2CSCHAT bind which
  gets forced to bind as "/" at character select, and does not exist while in game.
- Added /timed command, which executes a command after a specified duration (in deciseconds like pause)
  /timed <deciseconds> <command>
  Example: /timed 10 /echo 1 second has passed
  Note: This does NOT "pause" successive commands.
- Added /newif command, which ONLY does numeric compares -- use MQ2Data string comparison to 
  turn string compares into numeric compares -- and note that this means you do NOT use the "n"
  stuff.  This will replace the current /if command in MQ2Data phase 3.  Until then, you may 
  "/alias /if /newif" if you wish to use newif exclusively.
  /newif <calculations> <command>
  <calculations> gets evaluated down to a single term from however many terms there are (You
  may use && and || freely.) *BE WARNED* that in calculations parentheses are still not
  officially supported.. that's on my TODO list.
  

29 Mar 2004 by Lax (more)
- Added < <= == >= > && & || | to the Calculate function (someone rewrite if please... 
  fail if zero, fall through if non-zero)
- MQ2Data updates:
  * Added top level object: string If[conditions,whentrue,whenfalse]
  * Added type corpse, top level object: corpse Corpse
  * Added top level object: item Cursor
  * Added string members:
    - int Compare[text]: -1 if the string is alphabetically before text, 0 if equal, 1 if after. Case does not count.
    - int CompareCS[text]: -1 if the string is alphabetically before text, 0 if equal, 1 if after. Case counts.
  * Lots of others...
- Fixed MQ2Parm slowness from debug spew if MQ2Data is also in use
 
29 Mar 2004 by Lax
- Phase 1 of MQ2Data system rollout begins! Please start updating macros, custom uis, plugins,  
  etc to use this sytem.
  To use MQ2Data modify these MQ2Main lines
   #define USEMQ2PARMS
   //#define USEMQ2DATATYPES  
  Uncomment the USEMQ2DATATYPES #define to allow MQ2Data parsing.  If you wish to disable
  MQ2Parms parsing, comment the USEMQ2PARMS #define.  You may use both or just one.
  See this thread to see how MQ2Parms will be phased out 
      http://macroquest.sourceforge.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=6008
  See this thread to see how to use MQ2Data instead 
      http://macroquest.sourceforge.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=6022
  Specific information for plugins to add types and Top Level Objects will be available soon
- Moved a few functions to MQ2Inlines.h
- Fixed a performance issue in GetSpellByName
- Trying to detour an already detoured address will now fail instead of crashing
- Added some offsets to eqgame.h (mostly CListWnd), removed some offsets that were virtual
  functions and probably not used anyway.  If you are adding basic UI offsets to your plugins
  ask to have them in eqgame.h please (people were doing this with CListWnd offsets).

23 Mar 2004 by Amadeus
- Removed DisplayZem function and calls and $zone(ZEM)  ...rest in peace.

20 Mar 2004 by Lax
** eqgame.ini is no longer used/needed by MQ2!  All offsets have been integrated 
   into eqgame.h.  The client DATE/TIME are in eqgame.h also.
- Fixed /itemnotify
- Renamed the "SpawnListTail" stuff to "LocalPlayer", added "ControlledPlayer".  These are
  both EQPlayer and correspond to .. you.  If you're on a mount, the one thats moving is
  ControlledPlayer. ** Things that use PCHARINFO to get your spawn should be phased out.
- Added /docommand
- Added /dosocial
- Made some minor improvements in MQ2UserVars

16 Mar 2004 by Lax (after patch)
- Changed exe date/time checking to use the date/time strings compiled into the exe

16 Mar 2004 by Amadeus
- Updated the Spell Information Window with code provided by Koad in his Spell Search
  Plugin.

16 Mar 2004 by Lax
- Fixed remaining issues with binds and custom binds

15 Mar 2004 by Lax (more)
- Added remaining, un-named EQ binds to the MQ2 bind system.  Some are still unknown, and
  some I'm surprised exist enabled in the client in the first place, and you should be 
  careful with those...
- Added /dumpbinds command.  Example: "/dumpbinds bill" will dump all current binds to
  Configs\bill.cfg to be loaded later.
- Added "/filter mq [on|off]", which prevents anything at all from being displayed by MQ2
- Added "/squelch <command>", which does the following:
  * Step 1: turns mq filter off
  * Step 2: executes the command
  * Step 3: turns mq filter back to the state it was in before step 1
  In other words, executes a command and prevents any output from the command
  
  ** It is recommended that you do this in your .CFG files that you dont want to see output from
  /squelch /filter mq on
  < do your stuff here>
  /squelch /filter mq off
- I promise this is my last update for a few days at least!

15 Mar 2004 by Lax
- Fixed some bugs with binds and the MQ2CustomBinds plugin
- Modified bind system so that the same key can be bound to an MQ2 bind and an EQ bind and
  both will work
- Added a system to run .CFG files, similar to quake .cfg files I suppose.  The file must
  contain commands the same as you would use them normally.  Each command will be executed
  in order, there are NO macro blocks, events, etc, in a cfg file.
  * CFG files may be present in <release>\Configs\, in <release>\, or potentially in the
    EverQuest directory.  Note that <release> would be the same as wherever your Macroquest.ini is.
  * Added /loadcfg <filename> command.
  * Plugins can use LoadCfgFile(filename)
  * Configs that are automatically loaded:
		AutoExec.CFG - Executed on the first pulse
		CharSelect.CFG - Executed when you are put at character select
		<server>_<character>.CFG - Executed when this character enters the world
		<mapshortname>.CFG - Executed when you zone into this zone
		<pluginname>-AutoExec.CFG - Executed when this plugin is loaded (after its initialization is complete)

		Examples of file names:
		tallon_lordsoth.cfg - character
		oot.cfg, soldungb.cfg, soldunga.cfg, take.cfg - maps
		MQ2Map-AutoExec.CFG, MQ2ChatWnd-AutoExec.CFG - plugins 

14 Mar 2004 by Lax
- Added /ranged [#] command.  Run with no parameters to do a ranged attack on your current
  target, or with a spawn ID to do a ranged attack on that spawn.
- Modified MQ2Spawns, hopefully this will solve the remaining stack corruption problems...
- Introduction of the new MQ2 key binding system
  * New command /bind <list|eqlist|[~]name <combo|clear>>
  * "/bind list" will list all MQ2 binds
  * "/bind eqlist" will list all non-MQ2 binds
  * The following work on both MQ2 and EQ binds the same way
  * "/bind <name> <combo>" will set a bind's normal key combo (example: "/bind forward e")
  * "/bind ~<name> <combo>" will set a bind's alternate key combo (example: "/bind ~forward up")
  * Combos use any combination of "alt", "shift" and "ctrl" plus a key.  Specific keys follow the 
    same rules as the /sendkey and /press 
    Example combos:
    shift+n
    alt+shift+f1
    -- Always separate with +'s or spaces.
  * Note that "clear" combo is to clear the bind, and also note that changing EQ binds will not
    immediately update the display in the options window.  Change the bind list selection in the
    options window to see the updated keys.
  * /keypress works the same way with all MQ2 and non-MQ2 binds
  * API additions include:
     BOOL AddMQ2KeyBind(PCHAR name, fMQExecuteCmd Function);
     BOOL SetMQ2KeyBind(PCHAR name, BOOL Alternate, KeyCombo &Combo);
     BOOL RemoveMQ2KeyBind(PCHAR name);
     BOOL ParseKeyCombo(PCHAR text, KeyCombo &Dest);
     PCHAR DescribeKeyCombo(KeyCombo &Combo, PCHAR szDest);

     typedef VOID    (__cdecl *fMQExecuteCmd)(PCHAR Name,BOOL Down);
     -- Note: This function will be called when the key goes down as well as up.  If you create a
        MQ2 bind function make sure to account for this.  The "Name" parameter is the name of the
        bind
  * /hotkey command is now removed, the new bind system will take over
- MQ2CustomBinds plugin is now live.  This plugin allows you to specify custom commands to execute
  on a key combination.  There may be a command for the keys being pressed (down), and another for them
  being released (up).
  * /custombind <list|add <name>|delete <name>|clear <name><-down|-up>|set <name><-down|-up> <command>>
  * "/custombind list" will list all of your custom binds names and commands (the key combinations must be set using /bind)
  * "/custombind add <name>" will add a new bind name for use here, with /keypress, /bind, etc.
  * "/custombind delete <name>" will remove a custom bind
  * "/custombind clear <name><-down|-up>" will clear a specific command for a custom bind.  If up or down is not specified, defaults to down.
  * "/custombind set <name><-down|up> <command>" will set a specific command for a custom bind.  If up or down is not specified, defaults to down.
  * Example usage (NOTE: MQ2's very first bind command is "RANGED" so you do not need to do this, but for example...)
    /custombind add mybind
    /custombind set mybind /ranged
    /bind bind n
    -- To set the real RANGED bind, do "/bind ranged <key>"
   
13 Mar 2004 by Lax
- Added /multiline <delimiter> <command[delimiter[command[delimiter[...]]]]>
  Executes all commands.  Example: /multiline ; /stand;/rude;/sit
- Wave 3 of MQ2Map updates:
  * Added /maphide command to hide spawns on the map given a search string.  Hidden spawns
    only take effect until the mapped spawns are re-generated (such as changing some map
    filters)
    "/maphide reset" will re-generate the spawn list.
  * Added /mapshow command, to explicitly show spawns on the map given a search string.
    These will only take effect until the mapped spawns are re-generated (same as maphide).
    "/mapshow reset" will re-generate the spawn list.
  * Added /mapclick command and special right click commands (hold a combination of
    shift, control, left alt, right alt to execute a special command when right clicking
    on a spawn).  Defaults include left-alt right-click to highlight and control r-click to
    hide.
  * Added Group filter (requires PC) and NormalLabels filter (shows/hides non-MQ2 labels)  
- Added notice when a new XML file is added to the list while in game.  The notice
  says which file was added and that the user must reload the ui for it to take effect.
- Fixed crash when adding a custom XML file that doesnt exist in the default UI directory
- Fixed $macro crash

12 Mar 2004 by Lax
- MQ2Map overhaul completed
- Fixed /keypress crash bug when you're an idiot and type an invalid command name :)
- Fixed client override problem

11 Mar 2004 by Lax 
- I forgot to update the changes.txt file, so Amadeus is putting this here
  so the masses will know I added/fixed/updated a bunch of shit.

11 Mar 2004 by Amadeus

  When listing filters with /mapfilters, only options that have requirements are displayed
  Concolor filter is now PCConColor and NPCConColor
  Target filter now has 3 separate options - Target, TargetLine, TargetRadius

05 Mar 2004 by Amadeus
- Put in new CXWnd offsets [vzmule]
- Added structs in EQUIStruct.h for the Guildwindow and RaidWindow (work in progress)

05 Mar 2004 by Lax
- MQ2Map upgrade is now live.  It uses the new OnAddSpawn/OnRemoveSpawn API to increase efficiency.
  /highlight <spawn search string> will temporarily highlight these spawns
  /highlight color <#> <#> <#> will set the highlight color
  /highlight reset to reset the currently highlighted spawns
  Right clicking on spawns on the map now targets them
- /keypress command is now live. /keypress <name> <hold> like so:
  /keypress clear_target
  /keypress forward hold
  To release the key after holding, simply use the command again without the hold keyword.
- /itemnotify command is now live.  /itemnotify <slot> <notification>, or /itemnotify in <bag slot> <#> <notification>
  Bag slots are pack1-8, bank1-16 (and sharedbank1-2 and trade1-8 but these are not yet implemented in /itemnotify)
- Added OnAddGroundSpawn/OnRemoveGroundSpawn to plugin callbacks
- Fixed random crash on exit dealing with breakpoints

20 Jan 2004 by dkaa
    According to Pragma:
        1 bug: in the code for $rand(), there needs to be a srand(time(0));
        2 bug: in the code for $gamestate, $servername, and $loginname, the 
            value returned is 1 too high. You need to return length-1, which 
            is 8 for loginname and gamestate, and 9 for servername, this will 
            fix parsing issues.

18 Jan 2004 by Amadeus

31 Dec 2003 by Lax
- ESC no longer hides the MQ2ChatWnd or MQ2IRC windows and they are no longer closable

  use < and > by using "&lt;" and "&gt;", respectively)

31 Dec 2003 by Amadeus
- Added $spell(xx,spelltype),$spell(xx,targettype),$spell(xx,name),$spell(xx,aerange),
  $spell(xx,pushback),$spell(xx,resisttype),$spell(xx,resistadj),$spell(xx,fizzletime)

  [http://macroquest.sourceforge.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=33124#33124]
- Added Uninterruptable and Autocast to SPELL along with other fixes (thanks SoF & Koad)
- Added more functionality to the Spell Inspect Window.  You will now see the Effect of the 
  spell and the classes that can use it.  You might really find it interesting to 
  Alt-LeftClick on some of your buffs and find out exactly what they are doing to you!  It's
  almost like having an ingame Lucy connection -- and we owe a great deal of this functionality
  to Koad and borrowed code from his spellsearch plugin.
  
  **NOTE:  The formulas for this are still being tweaked.  If you wish to help iron these
           out, please post under Koad's thread on MQ2:Plugins board.  He is the keeper of 
           of the spell effects/slots formula. **

  ie, $target(castingspellid) rather than $target(CastingSpellID).
- Added <Sneak> to the superwho (thanks vzmule/source)

29 Dec 2003 by Lax
- MQ2Auth modified.
    * MQ2Auth now produces MQ2Auth0.h instead of MQ2Auth1.h and MQ2Auth2.h
    * MQ2Auth will import existing MQ2Auth2.h into MQ2Auth0.h if MQ2Auth0.h does not
      already exist but MQ2Auth2.h (in other words, it will import your "keyring" to
      MQ2Auth0.h)
    * MQ2Auth now accepts a command line parameter telling it the path to use
- Merged BOOK, COMMON, CONTAINER structs into ITEMINFO (the individual structs no
  longer exist!)

  about spells when you "examine" a spell from a gem or your spellbook: ID, Duration, 
  RecoveryTime, RecastTime, Range, AERange, PushBack, Resist Type and Resist Adjust.  
  You will notice that if a spell doesn't have any of these values, then that field 
  will not be shown at all.  (**More functionality to come later**)
- Added MQ2Bzrsearch to the VS.net solution file.

27 Dec 2003 by Lax

- / command correctly does EQ /who by default
- MQ2Telnet redone.
- Plugins using DoCommand() will execute it on the next pulse instead of immediately (corrects problems unloading the plugin)
- MQ2FPS shouldn't cause major problems when switching from absolute to calculate mode
- MQ2Template removed from VS6 workspace and .NET solution

25 Nov 2003 by Lax
- MQ2FPS now has a /fps command that can change some other settings.  Selecting "absolute" mode will switch to "cpu limiter" style, while "calculate" mode will switch to "fps limiter" style.  FPS limiter is default.  The same command will allow you to reposition the FPS indicator display.
- MQ2FPS display now shows a * if using absolute mode, and will show /MACRO if a macro is being executed that causes the limiting to be minimal
- Added aliases /g and /gu to the default list
- Macroquest2.exe now pops up a message box if the system failed to load MQ2Main.dll

fix for $merchant(name)

20 Nov 2003 by Lax
*** MacroQuest2.exe is now pre-compiled, you no longer compile this yourself.  MQ2Auth implemented.  Run it before compiling on each machine.

- MacroQuest program will no longer use loadlibrary, it loads our library directly.
- The version number is now stored in MQ2Main.h as the top line, and not in macroquest.ini.  When compiled it becomes a global variable.  Comparing the global variable gszVersion with the #define in MQ2Main.h will cause the tray icon tooltip to suggest recompiling if necessary.
- Removed EQADDR_SLOTLIST, which is now ppInvSlotMgr/pInvSlotMgr
- Fixed MQ2Telnet crashes (for real)
- Added DebugSpewNoFile which does not write to file even if debugspewtofile=1.  This is useful for when we can't put up with the file access times.  All Macro commands and parser api debug spew has been changed to this form.  Note that this debug spew is still useful for when you attach a debugger.

+Added new command /destroy
will destroy whatever you have on your cursor. Use with care.
example: /if "$cursor(name)"~~"rusty" /destroy
In order to get that to work I had to declare EQ_PC (MQ2Globals.h(250):EQLIB_VAR EQ_PC **ppPCData;)

- Fixed MQ2Telnet to not crash on unload (probably).  Critical sections were getting deleted twice.
- Fixed aliases to work when given parameters
